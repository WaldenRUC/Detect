Maybe it's my poet soul, or maybe the sickness is catching, but I swear I can feel the darkness growing in the corridors and access ways, in the spaces between the bulkheads that have become my refuge, even in my own skin. I think I read once that high intelligence is correlated with mental disorders. That would explain what happened here. After all, they do n't choose just anyone to work in this kind of environment. \n \n Carrie is alright, I guess. She certainly had the imagination to run a DoD contracted research and development firm. Unfortunately most of her best ideas were incidental to her main plans, and for some reason she never took the easy route. Like instead of just unplugging the damned mainframe she kept adding on to it when the AI got out of hand. And she had this weird obsession with this crazy researcher from the 60's. When I was selected I actually got to see the inside of her office, and it was covered floor to ceiling with memorabilia about this guy and his company. I do n't understand it; the guy was definitely a crackpot. Went from hiring folks like us to random bums on the street for research candidates. Anyway, Carrie is obsessed with finding out why he died and now I'm miles above anything normal trying to stay alive because of it. \n \n I met Pete and Ben in the planning room the day before launch. Carrie was communicating through an intercom, which is apparently how anyone has ever talked to her. Doug was there too. I worry about that guy a little less than I used to. Guess I have different standards about what'unhinged' means now. I was n't too happy with having him as our ground contact, and I could tell at first glance the others were n't either. Play enough in the sandbox, you get used to picking up when your soldiers are uneasy about a mission. I just thought it was about Doug. Never realized they knew more than me about Carrie and the Crackpot. \n \n I'll be honest, I kinda spaced out during the brief. Ben was a doctor, specializing in parasitic relationships and infectious disease. Pete introduced himself as a doctor of geology, and I made a joke about finding a rock's heartbeat. Should have been a clue when nobody laughed. What an arrogant prick I was. They were geniuses as much as I am, and they used it to advance our society. I squandered mine flying grunts to shoot other human beings. And I thought being a pilot made me somehow superior. Yep, ignored everything that was actually important. Blah blah, pick up asteroid fragment, blah blah, think it might have killed the old man, blah blah, not moon dust. Whatever. Get a rock flying at a few thousand miles per hour and get it to the nerds while I brag to the guys back home. Like I said, total jerk. \n \n Launch went fine. I was a bit concerned with using a refurb outdated space shuttle, but we made it through the pickup. Did my little tango and acted like an ass for days, relaxing and making myself a frozen steak for every meal while the others actually applied themselves in the research module. I think I drank the last three bottles of wine before the conference call to Carrie where Pete and Ben confirmed the asteroid contained something that killed the old guy. If only I paid attention. But no, I remember thinking Carrie's mom voice sounded hot before blacking out. \n \n Three days later Ben started acting odd. He was always focused, but he started snapping at us, insisting in fits of yelling that salvation lie within the rock, and that we must cultivate the microbes. His skin darkened on the fourth day, and by the sixth he'd been reduced to screaming unintelligibly from the research module when we locked him in. On the seventh Pete found a hole had been purposely cut in each of our hazard suits and locked himself in with Ben. On day ten the power failed and the locks opened while I was checking on them and the only reason I escaped was the sudden loss of gravity meant they lost traction. It's been a fortnight now, and I'm not feeling well. At all. \n \n Listen, Manny. You're the station's maintainer, and you've been floating up here longer than any of us. I bet you know these maintenance spaces and crumple zones like last month's issue of Playboy. If you're reading this, then you probably got my note at the airlock and still have the PAC-6 suit on. It'll filter out anything to the virus level, and it ca n't have been sabotaged since you were on that satellite recovery mission. I've stashed food throughout the inter-bulkhead spaces so they ca n't just sit on the kitchen and wait for you to get hungry. Pete began work on an antigen before turning. There's a few samples around the ship as well, but they wo n't protect you for long the way these buggers mutate. Use them wisely. \n \n I was never kind to you, so I can not call you a friend. But I hope in some way that my preparations can help you survive until the recovery ship arrives next week. Godspeed. \n \n -Cpt.

He rubbed his greying head of hair as he struggled to find the proper words for the current chapter. Giant bookshelves towered above him on each side. Fully covered with what seemed to be volumes of the same series. He sat with his back facing the door and rotated his chair to face it when the door started to creak lightly. \n The door slowly opened and a child wearing pyjamas emerged. `` Tommy'' the old man noted with a smile. `` It's unlikely for you to visit me at this hour, your mother does n't know you are here. Does she?'' The man took off his reading glasses and neatly placed them on his desk. He turned back to face Tommy, waiting for an reply. The child picked at his blonde hair as he tried to scavenge for an reply. `` No, she does n't.'' he solemnly replied. `` I thought so. In fact I would've known. You might be in big trouble!'' said the man jokingly. `` Now, Tommy. For what reason do you risk the wrath of your mother and an endless amount of chores?'' he asked as he patted the pile of books next to him, inviting the child to sit. Tommy walked towards the pile on his bare feet and sat down. `` Well, grandpa. Mom said you write a lot and never stop. I asked her what you write about and she did n't know. So I just wanted to know.'' he shyly replied. The elderly man chuckled and messed up the hair of the child beside him, forcing a smile from the boy. `` Do n't ever hesitate to ask questions Tom, only by asking question are you able to find answers.'' said the man `` I'm writing a story'' he added. \n `` A story? Like the ones mom reads me? `` asked the boy enthusiastically. The man looked at the boy with a hint of surprise `` Yes Tom, like those. Only slightly longer. I fear it is n't the kind of story your mother would be able to read you before bed. `` \n \n `` What is it about Grandpa? Dragons? Knights? The stories with dinosaurs are my favourite. `` \n A wide grin appeared on the face of the elderly man `` Heh, I guess that would've been *cool*'' he mockingly said `` But no, this story is about a woman.'' \n \n `` Is it about grandma? But she went to heaven right?'' asked the boy. \n The man avoided the eyes of the child for a moment before he replied. `` No, it is n't about grandma.'' \n `` But it about a very special women.'' \n The boy was n't sure how to reply `` Oh I see, but ca n't you take a break? It's my birthday next week and I hoped you'd come. You did n't make it there last time. `` \n His face pained with regret the old man answered the question `` I'm sorry Tom. I wo n't make it this time either, I have to write.'' \n `` But, why Grandpa?'' he asked as his eyes started to water up. \n The man faced the boy and placed his hands on his shoulders `` Tom'' he said `` I.. I have to write the story or else it wo n't continue. It's very important for the woman that the story continues. `` \n Using his sleeve, the boy wiped away his tears. `` Ca n't you make an exception? Just this once. We can get chocolate cake, your favourite. Just an one-time break?'' \n The man turned away from the boy and faced his desk. `` No Tom, I will never take a break again.'' \n `` So you've taken a break before?! Why ca n't you do it again?!'' cried the boy. \n The man sighed and said `` Remember the time your mother got sick and fell asleep for 3 weeks?''\n"}

Even the doctor standing in front of the door, flipping through his clipboard, did n't look up. \n \n “ Ah, you're here, ” he said, almost mumbling the words. \n \n “ Yes. ” \n \n He hesitated, leaving a page half-flipped for a moment, before lowering the clipboard. The wall beside me must have had something interesting to look at. “ Well, you've read the file, I presume? ” \n \n “ Yes. ” \n \n He nodded. “ Then, go ahead. ” He stepped to the side. \n \n I twisted the handle, opening the door without a creak. The dim room had little in common with most of the hospital, covered in soft tiles that did n't quite shine antiseptic white. Slits for windows meant it never looked particularly bright without the light on. \n \n What really set the room apart, though, was its occupant. Today, she sat on the edge of the bed, striped by sunlight. \n \n As usual, I took my seat in the middle of the room, cross-legged on the floor. \n \n Nothing changed, for a while. The padding muffled the rest of the world, and nothing in the room divulged the time, so I could n't say how long that while lasted. But, eventually, she moved. Her movements slow, she turned her upper body, leaning back on the bed. \n \n Her eyes looked familiar. \n \n She took her time staring at me, with no expression on her face. Then, she took more time to adjust herself, sitting on the edge facing me in a more comfortable manner. Finally, she spoke. \n \n “ Who are you? ” \n \n I did n't smile. “ I'm here to listen. ” \n \n “ Listen to what? ” \n \n “ Anything you would like me to listen to. ” \n \n She stared at me, and then just to the side of me. Her body did n't move with any tics, hands and legs still. The seconds trickled into minutes, and probably into hours given the movement of the slits of sunshine. \n \n The door rattled, and a nurse came in, balancing two trays. I accepted one with thanks, and the other tray got left on the bed amidst silence. The door closed once more. I ate the small portion of soup slowly, spreading out the bread to match how much soup I had left. After finishing the main meal, I moved on to the slightly melted ice-cream. Meanwhile, she had n't touched her food or, as far as I could tell, moved at all. \n \n Darkness soon slipped through the windows, displaced by the overhead light flickering on. It had a much colder tone, with a hint of blue. \n \n “ Go already. ” \n \n She had n't moved, not even her eyes. I did n't respond. \n \n “ How long are you gon na stay here? ” \n \n “ As long as it takes. ” \n \n “ For what? ” \n \n “ For you to tell me what you want me to listen to. ” \n \n She did n't laugh, or roll her eyes, or rub her brow. Nothing changed about her, but her lips when she spoke, and the soft rise and fall of her chest as she breathed. \n \n “ What kind of a job is that? ” \n \n I adjusted what she said slightly, and answered, “ It's my job to listen to whoever is in this room, and answer any questions they may have for me. ” \n \n “ Ah, you're the shrink who has to listen to the crazies. ” \n \n She showed some emotion with that last word, her lips curving into a glimmer of a smile. \n \n “ Does n't it drive you mad, listening to us? ” \n \n “ No, it doesn't. ” \n \n That set off another stretch of silence, which infected the world at large as the hospital wound down for the night. Matching that, the light above dimmed, giving the whole room the appearance of being in shadow. What little colour remained became muted, a shade of grey and nothing more; her hair, her skin, the hospital gown, and her eyes. \n \n “ Why not? ” she asked, and her voice had quieted too, matching. \n \n I thought I knew, but asked, “ Why not what precisely? ” Perhaps if the light had n't dimmed, I may have seen the flashes that trailed in her features, but the shadows blurred them. \n \n “ Sitting there, listening to pain day after day, why does n't that hurt you? ” \n \n I held my reply a beat, and asked, “ Do you really want to know? ” \n \n Her gaze shifted minutely, from the side of my face to my eyes. It delayed her reply, but it eventually came. “ Yes. ” \n \n “ I do n't have emotions. ” \n \n Her eyes reacted, once more though blurred by the dim lighting. “ How can you even do your job? ” \n \n “ My job is to listen, not to feel. ” \n \n “ What good does that do? ” \n \n “ A lot. ” \n \n She held her reply between pursed lips, letting it fade away. After a while, she instead asked, “ Why would telling you help me now I know you do n't care? ” \n \n “ You're mistaken, I do care. ” \n \n “ How can you possibly care if you're dead inside? ” \n \n “ If I made a robot, could I make it empathise without having emotions of its own? ” \n \n Her mouth stayed open for a moment, before she replied. “ I do n't know. ” When no reply came from me, she rephrased her earlier question. “ How can you care without emotions? ” \n \n “ I value human life and well-being. ” \n \n “ But, how can you do that? ” \n \n “ I choose to. It's the axiom of my morality. ” \n \n “ But… why? If it ca n't ever make you happy, why do anything? ” \n \n “ If I did n't do anything, I would n't be here. ” \n \n “ That's not an answer. ” \n \n “ It's the closest one I can give. The only one, in fact. ” \n \n “ So, you do things because you do things? ” \n \n “ Yes. I'm like a robot who has been asked why it does what it has been programmed to do. ” \n \n “ Is that how you see yourself? ” \n \n “ No. ” \n \n My answer sat on her lips, silently echoed back to me. Then, she asked, “ Would you be sad if I killed myself? ” \n \n “ No. ” \n \n “ Would you cry at my funeral? ” \n \n “ No. ” \n \n “ Would you stay up late into the night, trying to think what you could have done differently to save me? ” \n \n “ No. ” \n \n My answers sat on her lips, accompanied by a smile. “ No, huh? ” \n \n “ No, I wouldn't. ” \n \n She leant forwards, and the shadows darkened over her face, veiling it in a blur that hid her away. “ Do you hate me? ” \n \n “ No. ” \n \n “ Liar, ” she said. “ You'd rather I just spilled my guts to you. Instead, I'm asking stupid questions, wasting your time. ” \n \n I did n't reply, and she grew as restless as she'd been since I walked in, swiping a finger back and forth across her knee. \n \n “ Am I crazier than the rest? ” \n \n “ I do n't know. ” \n \n “ Well, did you already fix them all by now? ” \n \n “ Most. ” \n \n “ Am I the most difficult one of them all? ” \n \n “ I think so, based on my intuition of how this will go. ” \n \n Her finger stilled. “ What makes me difficult for you? ” \n \n “ I think you've convinced yourself that no one will ever genuinely care about you, that no matter how hard you try to come back from this trauma, it will haunt you forever and keep everyone else distant. That's difficult to begin to overcome while I'm being completely honest about myself. ” \n \n She did n't reply. \n \n “ Has that answered your question sufficiently? ” \n \n “ You should… ” she said, so softly I only caught the beginning. \n \n “ Pardon? ” \n \n “ You should have lied to me. ” \n \n Her words brought silence, ticking on and on. The atmosphere did n't help with drowsiness, but I had had enough practice to keep myself awake. \n \n “ Why send someone who ca n't care to help someone who needs to feel cared for? ” she asked, a sudden end to the quiet. \n \n “ I'm not here to help. I'm here to listen. ” \n \n “ What good does that do? ” \n \n She had already asked that, and I gave her the same answer. “ A lot. ” \n \n “ What good does that do for me? ” \n \n “ I do n't know yet. ” \n \n “ Then why should I bother telling you anything? ” \n \n “ It might help. ” \n \n “ I thought you were n't here to help? ” \n \n “ A fortunate side-effect, but it's not something I can promise. ” \n \n “ What can you promise, then? ” \n \n “ I can promise to listen to anything you'd like me to listen to. ” \n \n Her finger curled, so the trimmed nail pressed into her knee. “ What if I do n't want to say anything? ” \n \n “ That's fine. ” \n \n “ What if I tell you a ton of lies? ” \n \n “ That's fine. ” \n \n “ What if I tell you really twisted, disgusting stuff? ” \n \n “ That's fine. ” \n \n “ So anything's okay, huh? ” \n \n “ As long as you want me to listen to it. ” \n \n “ What does that even mean? What I want you to listen to? Is n't that just hearing what I say? ” \n \n “ No, it means what it means. Speaking might help some people, but, in my experience, speaking to someone helps more often. Of course, you're free to say aloud whatever you like, but I'm here to listen if there's anything you want to say to someone. ” \n \n She did n't reply, and the silence settled in for a while once again. Despite the time I had spent in the room, I had n't been able to use the moon to tell time, though I did n't even know if that was possible to do. I guessed it probably neared midnight, though. \n \n “ I… I do n't want any cop-out answer this time. ” \n \n Amongst the gloom, her face swirled, whatever she felt masked behind the darkness. \n \n “ Will telling you help me? ” \n \n I tried to see through the shadows and meet her gaze. “ No, I do n't think so. ” \n \n She did n't smile, or laugh, or look away from me. “ Will you listen anyway? ” \n \n “ Yes. ”\n"}

Just like every other day of my life I woke up at 7 o'clock, let the dog out, took a shower, ate breakfast, brushed my teeth, went to work. \n \n Ah yes, work. You see like most people I hated my job but it payed the bills. I was your standard low level paper pusher for a fortune 500 company; which one is n't really important they're all basically the same anyways. I sat at my desk waiting for the hands on the clock to be pointed at five and twelve. My boss was likely going to yell at me for something that I could n't reasonably be held responsible for. Those low billion assholes are all the same, get a promotion and a little more money in their pocket and they suddenly become God's green gift to whatever room they walk into. Luckily it was Friday and I would n't have to deal with that particular brand of bullshit for a whole two days soon. \n \n 4,143,812,573, my paycheck probably just dropped into my checking account. That's what I thought anyways until I saw it tick down again. \n \n 4,143,812,572. Then again, 4,143,812,571. And again, 4,143,812,570. I did n't think much of it at first. Sometimes people die and it ticks down a couple numbers and then some people are born and it ticks back up. The number was always in flux, it hardly sat on the same number for more than a few seconds because of it. \n \n 2,612,241,498. That's when the alarms started going off in my head. This is not normal. I decided I'd go to an ATM on my lunch to try and figure out what was going on probably just a computer error but I had to be sure. \n \n 2,000,000,543. I could n't even make it to lunch. I showed my econiband to my boss who laughed a little under his breathe, not quite a snicker but still condescending, `` I know how much you make. That number ca n't be right, you should go get it sorted out.'' Prick. \n \n 1,207,215,032. My pace quickened as the number continued to plummet. It just could n't be that low. I did n't *want* my number to be that low. I *liked* being mediocre. \n \n 542,004,785. Finally, my bank was in my sights. At this point I was almost sprinting. \n \n 1,000,001. I was about to tick under a million when I burst through the door. There was a line of about six people ahead of me. Good, I had a chance to catch my breathe and compose myself before talking to the teller. I bead of sweat dripped down my cheek and fell squarely onto my econiband. \n \n 19..... `` Next!'' I thrust my wrist under the scanner. John Moyenne, 31, Global Econ rating 19, Current account balance $ 28,000,000,000. \n \n That could n't be right, it just could n't. The teller gave me a look of disbelief that said he thought the same. \n \n `` One moment Mister Moyenne, I think you should be talking to someone...'' he paused for a moment, `` Above my pay grade.'' I glanced at his wrist and saw that his econiband was hovering in the high six billion range. I felt bad when I blurted out, `` You're probably right.'' \n \n The teller stepped away from the counter and was gone for what seemed like an hour but was probably only 10 minutes or so. `` Would you mind following me Mister Moyenne,'' said a female voice coming from behind me. I turned around and saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen standing behind me. She was about six feet tall with black hair in a pixie cut and wore a pencil skirt with a frilled black top that. She had a knowing smile across her face that showed the slightest hint of dimples on her cheeks. Her teeth were whiter than fresh snowfall on a mountain top. And her curves, oh the curves on this woman. To say she had an hourglass frame would be an understatement but I ca n't think of a better way to describe them. I hardly even noticed the two gargantuan men in all black suits that flanked her. \n \n I expected her to pull me into a back office but instead she started walking out the front door. I trailed a few paces behind her and the suits a few paces behind me. One of them opened the door to a luxury sedan and she climbed in beckoning me to follow. The door slammed behind me just as I sat down. \n \n I glanced at her wrist for the first time to look at her econiband as I was too distracted by the rest of her before. Most econibands were clunky pieces of plastic with an LED display that looked like a child's watch. Not hers though, it was well designed. Sleek and tailored to her wrist. It was made of some kind of black metal with red and gold spirals that almost looked like flames. The most startling thing about it was the number though. An unwavering 666 that was *engraved* into it. \n \n `` Do you like it? I can have one made for you,'' she said eyes looking towards the driver indicating that he should start driving. `` It would have your number on it, not mine, of course,'' she added playfully looking at me for the first time since ushering me out of the bank. \n \n `` There has to be some sort of mix up. I'm-'' \n \n `` There is no mix up Mr. Moyenne,'' she interrupted me, `` You've been selected for a... unique opportunity if you will.'' \n \n `` Can you explain to me what in the hell kind of opportunity puts 28 billion dollars into my account?'' \n \n `` In due time. Would you like a refreshment?'' \n \n `` No,'' I responded curtly. \n \n `` Oh... are you sure? It's going to be a long ride.'' \n \n `` I'm positive.'' \n \n My mind began racing. What opportunity could put *28 billion fucking dollars* into my account. My gaze was fixated on her econiband when the car finally came to a stop. My hand instinctively went to open the door. \n \n `` Just a moment Mr. Moyenne, I think we should do a little prefacing before we begin discussing the details of the opportunity you are about to be presented with,'' she said while gently placing her hand on mine to stop me from opening the door, `` Have you figured out who I am yet?'' \n \n `` I have a guess,'' I said timidly. \n \n `` Go on then, who do you think I am?'' Their was a grin on her face that unsettled me as if she already knew what I was going to say. \n \n `` Well, based on your econiband I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say Satan.'' \n \n `` Clever boy!'' she exclaimed, `` Most people do n't get it that quickly, in fact, about half of them make me do the whole fire and brimstone show for them.'' \n \n We sat in silence for a moment; awkwardly, at least it was awkward for me, staring at each other. \n \n `` Do you want me to do the fire and brimstone? I can if that's more to your liking.'' \n \n `` That's okay, I'll take a rain check,'' she giggled a little. \n \n `` Oh? What's the matter then, you've got this look perplexed look on your face and while I am Satan, I ca n't read minds.'' \n \n `` No one's ever called me clever before.'' \n \n `` Today, I think, will be filled with firsts for you Mr. Moyenne.''\n"}

As they came closer and closer, sam stuck out her arm, pen and book in hand. Since she did n't really want to look at them, she faced her friends instead, standing sideways from the gate. At the very least, she could show her sister that she had met a celebrity. \n Then she felt something. The hand that grabbed for her pen gave her a painful shock. She looked over, ready to give the guy the evil eye for dragging his feet on the carpet, when she stopped. His eyes were wide. She immediately realized what had happened. Fudge on a stick. He was n't even her type anyway.\n"}

As the man himself came forward and climbed into the ring, the crowd eventually quieted enough for the announcer to continue. \n `` And in the opposite corner,'' he cried into the microphone, voice amplified by hundreds of speakers throughout the arena, `` A man who truly needs no introduction.... JOHN CENA!'' \n Lights flashed, sound roared, and the crowd positively lost itself. As Cena stepped forward, his iconic theme music began to play, repeated through the speakers of the arena, as well as televisions and computers around the world. \n \n Many miles away from the arena where the world was focused, the ground rumbled and cracked open. Fire spilled out onto the barren desert floor, turning a vast swath of land into glass. From the bowels of the Earth ( so it seemed, though technically from a bubble of a parallel dimension ) poured a swarm of demons, ghouls, and various hellbeasts. Moments later, the heavens were torn asunder and out rushed the heavenly host, cherubim and seraphim alike. \n An outside observer might have imagined that this was the apocalypse, and they would only be half right. For while it was indeed the final battle for the fate of Heaven, Hell, and Earth, it was not to be fought by armies, but by single combat between two champions. The assembled hosts of heaven and hell had gathered to form a ring, into which stepped one of the largest angels and one of the mightiest demons. Michael and Beelzebub had been enemies in many epic wars of the past, for every conflict between humans was mirrored by a celestial battle. But they were not to meet in combat this day. \n *THE TRUMPETS OF ARMAGEDDON HAVE BEEN SOUNDED*, they bellowed with one voice. *HEAVEN AND HELL MEETING IN THE FINAL BATTLE FOR EARTH. * \n Michael took a step backwards and Beelzebub continued alone. *REPRESENTING HELL, THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS, THE FIRST EVIL, THE MORNING STAR..... LUUUUUUUUUUUCIFER! * \n A roar went up from the collected demons as a dark, shadow emerged from the entrance to Hell, spreading to cover the sky from horizon to horizon before coming together in the ring to form the body of Lucifer. Beelzebub then stepped back to allow Michael to introduce Heaven's champion. \n *IN THE OTHER CORNER, REPRESENTING HEAVEN, THE GREAT I AM, THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA, THE KINGS OF KINGS..... NO WAY, IT'S YAHWEEEEEEHHHHH! * \n A corresponding roar came from the assembled angels as the world was covered in pure light, which faded to reveal Yahweh standing in the ring next to Michael. \n \n Mere minutes later, at the same time an announcer in a Las Vegas arena ordered the beginning of a match between Cena and the Undertaker, the combined voices of Michael and Beelzebub roared *FIGHT! *\n"}

Having lived in a house with a group of very fat people, Harry at first did not register this as strange. \n \n `` Oi, Arry. You awake.'' The heavy breathing turned into a cough which woke harry from his feigned slumber. The man was large, so large in fact that his back brushed against the ceiling. It was the only apparent way the giant could fit. \n \n `` Who the....'' \n \n The fat man jumped across the room and put a large smelly hand over Harry's mouth, muting whatever cry he was about to let out. \n \n `` Ey, ey steady now'' he whispered, blowing out his moustache `` I'm not ere to urt you'' \n \n After a moment of struggling Harry eventually gave up, and a moment after that the fat man released him and plonked him ungraciously back down onto the bed. Harry hoped that no-one had heard that, because if they had he would be sleeping without bed clothes again for a month. \n \n `` I'm Hagrid'' Hagrid said, pulling something out of his coat pocket. `` And Hagrid has something for you'' \n \n Harry looked at him cautiously before taking the letter from his hands. It was plain and white, with small indentations. `` What is this?'' \n \n `` I'm sorry Harry, but i dont know. I was given that here letter with the instruction not to open it till it was in your hands. Or no wait, i was instructed to let you open the letter in my hands. Yes that must have been it.'' \n \n Hagrid grabbed the letter roughly off harry and knelt down to present the letter again. Not really knowing what was going on, Harry motioned to open the letter but Hagrid suddenly grabbed it away again. \n \n `` How about i open it for you and you read it'' \n \n Harry was beginning to become annoyed at the fat man who had intruded on his sleep. He folded his arms `` Why ca n't i just open it myself?'' \n \n `` Because Dumbledore was very clear, he said not to let anyone read that letter but you. So that means i open it and you read it'' \n \n `` That is not what that means!'' Harry hissed, making a move to grab the letter again but Hagrid was too fast pulling the letter away just as harry got a hold of it. In a moment of stillness, Harry heard the ripping of envelope followed by a strange green flame that engulfed the letter and whatever was inside it. Shortly after that the room returned to stillness. \n \n Hagrid and Harry sat staring at one another for a while, Hagrid eventually poking at the ash that had once been the letter. `` I guess you were right, sorry about that. Its a failsafe mechanism, only ive never seen them burst into flames like that, they usually just let out a roar'' \n \n Hagrid scooped up the ash and put it into his pocket. `` Well, sorry about that. I do have another letter for you. And i was given very specific instruction only to give it to you only if that there letter burst into flames'' \n \n Harry sat glaring at the fat man, he found none of this funny. It was bad enough that he had to live under the stairs, but now he had to be woken up in the middle of the night by fat hairy pyromaniacs who stole his letters. `` Are you going to let me open it'' \n \n `` Well, seeing as how the last one decided to explode, i think we'll let you open this one'' Hagrid said, handing the letter to Harry with newfound care. \n \n Without waiting for Hagrid to snatch it back, Harry ripped open the envelope and read: \n \n `` Hello World, \n \n You have been accepted into the window's school for World of War-craft and installer wizardry. If you have read this far, it means you are both literate and have opened the letter correctly, otherwise it would be engulfed by flame and be thoroughly unreadable. The first letter contained an invitation to the Hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizardry, but seeing as you destroyed that one, we can only assume that a life as a computer wizard is more suitable'' \n \n Harry looked slowly up at the fat Giant, who was behind him trying to read the letter. The giant had a sort of strange look on his face, as if trying to hold in laughter or very bad gas. \n \n `` I was going to be a wizard, and you destroyed the letter?'' \n \n Hagrid scratched his head and moved quickly toward the window, which he had broken to gain access to the room. `` So sorry about that Arry, but whats done is done. That's never happened before'' \n \n `` So you can fix it? \n \n `` No, ca n't be fixed. I was given instruction to not allow you to change your letter once you had destroyed the first'' \n \n Harry felt like hitting Hagrid. What did he mean `` once'' he had destroyed the first. Was this planned. \n \n `` Hagrid you fat piece of....'' \n \n But before Harry could finish what he was going to say, Hagrid had jumped out the window and disappeared across the sky on a motor bike leaving Harry staring open mouthed out the window, clutching the invitation letter in his hands. \n \n A loud bang at the door forecasted the entry of his Uncle Vernon who almost barrelled into Harry in his anger. `` You! Get to bed and quit shouting out the window! I swear your aunt is at her wits end. She has choir in the morning boy!'' \n \n \n\n"}

The kind that spiraled slightly upwards at each end. The kind that somehow neatly matched his round bald head and his curly locks of chest hair. \n \n Even as rugged a man as he is, Alex Bennett enjoyed the delicate things in life. Particularly high tea and knitting. After sipping earl grey from his bone china cup and enjoying a selection of assorted biscuits, Alex Bennett would get to work, knitting an array of sweaters and socks and mittens. Somehow, his stocky fingers were able to produce the most delicate patterns of leaves and flowers. This was, of course, after his retirement. \n \n Alex Bennett worked in a petite bakery shop which sold an array of pound cakes, cupcakes, and cheesecakes. He had a sweet tooth and very much enjoyed the 40 % employee discount which came as one of the perks of his job. Customers were often startled by his look, but he calmed their spirits with his soft spoken voice and friendly demeanor. At the petite bakery shop, Alex Bennett was in charge of decorating cakes. And he did so with designs as intricate as those on his hand knitted sweaters. \n \n Alex Bennett enjoyed his quiet, solitudinous life. He never had any girlfriends, for he may have seemed too intimidating for any to approach. Although he never understood why people were often startled and overwhelmed by his guise, he paid no mind to it, for he was content with his life, knitting and drinking high tea. And when Alex Bennett finally passed away at the age of 81, he was alone, knitting in his country home. \n \n Nobody found the body of Alex Bennett, who seemed to have simply disappeared.

Kevin Fenwick, 72 year old, died during a triple bypass, said that it perhaps felt like something was'anticipated' but could n't elaborate further. \n Angela had considered hanging around the hospitals like a ghoul, waiting for more people to die but she did n't feel particularly comfortable with that. She was n't *that* kind of journalist. \n \n So she'd engaged the help of her ex boyfriend and her University flatmate, both former med students, both now in medicine. \n But most importantly, both easy to manipulate because they'd had an affair behind Angela's back and they both owed her massively. \n `` This is bonkers, Ange,'' griped Warwick, `` truly fucking crackers. Even for you.'' \n `` You're gon na do it it though, right?'' \n Warwick cast a look at Yasmin, the former flatmate. \n `` Yeah, we'll do it,'' Yasmin replied miserably, `` but you need to make it clear in writing that this was your fucked up idea and if anything goes wrong, we're not liable. Informed consent and all that, yeah?'' \n `` Definitely. I've already got the documentation drawn up, signed and sealed.'' \n The plan was simple; Warwick and Yasmin were going to drop her body temperature, stop her heart and let her die for a few minutes. During this time, Angela would try to observe as much as possible, to try and find out what was happening on the'other side'. \n \n She was shivering and doubting her wisdom just before the first attempt. The bathtub was lined with icepacks and a swathe of medical equipment was on hand. Warwick had the defibrillator paddles in his hand and looked concerned. \n `` Do n't you fuckin' kill me and claim I did n't come back,'' quipped Ange, `` I know how you'd like to get out of my bad books permanently.'' \n `` Ready?'' \n `` Ready.'' \n Yasmin pushed down the plunger for the anaesthetic. Angela felt a bit wobbly, then horribly drunk. \n Then nothing. \n \n Blackness. \n Loneliness. \n Emptiness. \n Angela had the faint sensation of bodily awareness, but she was n't standing on anything. It felt like she was experiencing everything through a huge wall of thick black treacle. She searched for the sensation that Kevin Fenwick had mentioned; the anticipatory feeling, and grasped a thread of *something* in the bitter, choking void. \n She tried to reach for it, but her limbs were phantom sensations, not quite real - inhibited by the nothingness. \n The void suddenly exploded in a rush into the deafening sounds of Warwick and Yasmin bringing her back to life; \n `` CLEAR!'' Roared Warwick. \n `` WAIT!'' \n The steady, happy chirp of the heart monitor had resumed and Angela was back in the world of the living. \n Warwick looked haggard. \n `` I hope to fuck you found what you were looking for, luv.'' \n Angela managed through chattering teeth, \n `` We're trying again tomorrow.'' \n \n Angela managed to convince them to put her out two more times, saying that she'd just find someone else to do it. She pleaded, promising that their debt to her would be erased forever. \n They agreed. \n The second time Ange went under it was almost the same; until right near the end she could feel her limbs and felt like she was standing on something. But then she was back before she could do anything with the sensation. \n This time would be different though. \n She could feel her bare feet in the infinite void and they stood on something cool and smooth. Angela fumbled around with arms that she could half feel now. \n In the blackness they collided with what felt like a smooth sphere of metal - as cool to the touch as the unseen floor. \n White and blue light exploded around her. \n She was standing in a white room that was as infinite as the void had been, but she could see her naked body now. Before her on a plain white column hovered a metal sphere and from it fanned out a holographic display in blue light. She squinted at the characters, then found a phrase in English: \n \n If you are reading this message, then the AfterLife simulation has suffered a critical error. \n Details of the error are below. \n \n Disbelieving, Angela scanned down to another passage in English which read: \n \n Verbal interface available on request. Please say'Help'. \n \n `` Help!'' yelped Angela. \n A smooth, angelic, androgynous voice responded, \n `` How may I help you Angela?'' \n `` What in the bloody hell is going on?'' \n `` The AfterLife simulation has reached maximum load. No new memory uploads can be processed.'' \n Angela blinked rapidly. \n `` Wot? Who runs this bloody thing? Who made it? Where is Heaven and God?'' \n The voice soothed her anxiety as it spoke; `` The AfterLife project was conceived in the year 4393 AD after a hyperspatial time wormhole was discovered leading back to prehistoric Earth. As nothing that could interfere with the timeline could be sent back, scientists decided to take pity on their primitive, spiritual ancestors and create a post-life simulation; since memory storage and immortality technology was not available to primitive humans. \n Unfortunately the data load and processing power required to continue running the simulation has exceeded design parameters. The designers did not properly anticipate how active the'faithful' would be in the afterlife simulation. Even 40th century technology could not cope.'' \n `` So what happens now?'' \n `` Now, I'm afraid you're all going to have to grow up and accept that there is no God.'' \n \n Angela woke up in hospital, anxious faces hovering over her. \n She had her story. \n\n"}

A", "human": "Jerome hit the send button and slipped the phone into his pocket. He squinted his eyes up at the midday sky and waited. A minute passed, then two. He turned his gaze toward those around him, looking for any sign of change. Hurried looking men walked past without a glance, just as they did everyday. Silk ties flapping in the breeze, they filed in and out of the skyscrapers. He wondered how many of them would lose their jobs after today. Behind the beautiful glass, inside the concrete towers, how many of these men made their living on the suffering of others. \n \n Click, click, click. On the other side of the sidewalk a pair of heels dug themselves into the concrete, effortlessly gliding along. The heels led up to a pair of long and shapely legs, and a beautiful woman. Everything about the woman was designer made, the oversized sunglasses, the undersized skirt, even the paper bags she carried. He ’ d never seen her before in his life, all the same he felt like he ’ d seen her everyday for the last five years. She was the type that would go into the stores with the huge crystal windows and come out carrying load of bags. of course, making extra sure the names on the sides of the bags were prominently displayed. \n \n She wouldn ’ t give him a dime, she would n't even give him smile, but still he watched her as she walked. To his surprise she stopped right in front of him. His heart skipped a beat. Maybe she would put her bags down, take the sunglasses off, and see him. If this woman could see through the dirty clothes, see through the unkempt beard, and see him for what he truly was, a fellow human being, her brother, he knew his wish had come true. \n \n Instead he saw why she had stopped. A family of tourist had poured out of a yellow cab, and was now blocking the flow of foot traffic. They gaped up, trying to see the tops of the immense buildings, camera phones at the ready. The woman, whose face had been beautiful and elegant a second before, scowled. She silently pushed her way through with all the grace of a rhinoceros. She hadn ’ t seen Jerome, and he would never see her again. \n \n Eyes on the ground, Jerome felt like a fool. He stared at the cardboard he was sitting on and tried to drown out the noise. But, through everything, through the footsteps and the sirens, through the endless car horns, and the buzz of a million people, he heard a single noise, -CLANK-. He looked up, and saw a small girl, no more than six years old. She had blonde hair, bright as the sun. Cheeks so rosy they looked like candy apples. She had dropped a single quarter into his tin can. He wanted to smile at her, but he didn ’ t want to scare her, he was missing so many teeth. He wanted to hug her, to tell her that his wish had been for her. He had wished for a better future for her, for every little girl, and little boy, and man and woman in the world. He had wished for peace. But then a man came up, and grabbed the little girl by the arm. \n “ Susie, what are you doing? Come here. ” He dragged her away. Jerome looked down once again, “ Thank you. ” he muttered. \n \n It had all been a lie, the dream, the phone, everything. He reached into his pocket, half expecting it to be empty. The phone was in his hand, and he wondered if he was going insane. Thinking back to the previous night, everything was so clear in his mind, it wasn ’ t just any dream. He remembered waking up in the middle of the night. A voice, thunderous, yet silent, full of power, so much so that he wanted to cower in fear, yet so loving, so caring, “ JEROME, JEROME, WAKE UP. ” Immediately his eyes had opened, and he was standing. He felt awake. Awake like he had never felt before. Most of all he remembered the silence. The city around him was empty, not a single person or car to be seen. The buildings were dark, the streets deserted, as if it had been abandoned a century before, no, a minute before. In that moment the most intense light he had ever seen in his life shone above him. So intense was the light that it pushed him to the ground. The light pushed him down and went through him. The light was in his body and in his mind. He squeezed his eyes shut so tightly it hurt, but never before had he seen such brightness. He had fallen to the ground, and in that moment he felt a presence in front of him. It had spoken to him. \n \n “ YOU AMONG MANY HAVE BEEN CHOSEN. AM, WHO SENT ME, HAS DELIVERED ONTO YOU, THE FATE OF THIS WORLD. I GIVE TO YOU THIS CELLPHONE. YOU ARE TO SEND ONE REQUEST. AM, WHO CREATES AND DESTROYS, WHO GIVES AND TAKES AWAY, WILL GRANT IT. ” Then the words had stopped, and he felt the presence leave, and the light fade. With the fading of the light, he had slipped out of consciousness. When he awoke, it was daytime. The city was just as it always had been, buzzing with life and activity. The only change was that in his pocket, he found something that had not been there the day before, a cellphone. \n \n Jerome had been living on the streets for five years, but he knew what cell phones were in style, and this was not one of them. It was rectangular, with a small green screen, and face buttons. The buttons were the numbers one through zero, with letters under each, and a space symbol under the zero. On top of the numbered buttons, right under the screen, was a green button, “ Send ”. It looked, obsolete, like something Nokia had released in 1999. The screen had one thing written in small-digitized letters, “ Write Message: ” Jerome had known what he had to do. He typed, “ May God bless the world with peace. ” and hit send. \n \n That had been fifteen minutes ago, but nothing seemed to have changed. Jerome stared at the phone. “ I wonder what peace even looks like? ” he thought, as he saw the little girl ’ s family walking away. “ God bless you! ” He yelled after them. At that moment two things happened at the exact same time. Jerome felt something hit him on his head, and he saw a small object fall down the sky and straight into someone ’ s mouth. One of the tourists that had been staring wide-mouthed at the giant buildings was now convulsing on the sidewalk and clutching at his throat. In the confusion, half the crowd rushed towards him, while the other half tried to get away, leaving everyone stuck. \n \n What no one seemed to notice was that the sky had gotten considerably darker. At that moment it opened up, and unleashed the most intense hailstorm Jerome had ever seen. Everyone dispersed, and the choking tourist was dragged away to cover. Not believing that a hailstorm had broken out in the middle of summer, Jerome stood up, and realized it wasn ’ t hail at all. There were small orbs falling from the sky. Thousands, millions of them, smashing into the concrete and splattering into green goo. There were so many of them that Jerome could barely see. “ What the hell is this? ” he thought. ‘ These things look like… ” \n \n Gripping the phone, he ran as fast as he could for cover, being pelted as he went. Pushing his way through a glass door, he found himself in the lobby of one of the buildings and surrounded by people screaming, staring in disbelief at the sight outside. They were all covered in the green goo. Jerome pressed one of the buttons on the phone, and scanned the screen. He read the message, read it again. “ May God bless the world with… ” “ peas. ” Jerome ’ s body slumped to the ground, the phone slipping from his hand. For forty days and forty nights peas fell on New York City. \n \n Many decades later, when the history books were being written, when the media frenzy had subsided, after every last scientist had been baffled, and the Great Pea War was over, a unit of the US Army returned to the spot where Jerome had fallen. As they cleared debris, preparing for the arrival of the first re-settlers of Manhattan Island, they found the skeleton of a middle aged, African-American man. It had been pea-fossilized after decades of burial, and identification was impossible. But next to the remains they found an old phone, a relic of a by gone era. Somehow it still turned on, and on the screen were the words: “ Message delivered. Auto-correct: On ”.\n"}

But i must tell you this in case i die. It is not advised that we tell you the condition that we are in, but seeing as this may be my last letter i owe you that at least. I'm scared. My battalion survived the landing on foreign soil but at the cost of 85 % of our men. I've seen young men die fighting for something they do n't understand. I have not eaten in days and we have been pinned in the Tree line by German forces while awaiting for backup with no end to the battle in sight. In the dead of night i hear voices, i thought i was crazy. Maybe i am crazy. Shirley, at night when the gun fire comes to a halt and the troops start to daze off in the face of death i am convinced i hear whispers. Not the whispers of soldiers but the whispers of something greater. I feel as if while i'm in this foxhole i can hear the voices of people filled with wisdom, truth and sanity pouring in over my head. I've heard the end is near to this battle but i fear as i also have been told that it is not my mission to survive. Am i crazy? I cant be crazy. I even told the fellow solider in my foxhole to see if he heard them too, he said i was crazy. Told me to shrug off what i heard as war makes even the soundest of people question their sanity. But i know Shirley. I know what i heard. \n \n With Love, \n \n -Charlie \n ________________________________________________________________ \n \n \n ________________________________________________________________ \n Dear Shirley Edwards, \n \n We regret to inform you of the news that Charlie Edwards has been killed in action. The letter we have attached was found on his body in Normandy on June 24th 1944 on the final day of what is now to be known as the Battle Of Normandy. You're Husband fought valiantly and with honor. He was a role model to the men and maintained his stature till the end. \n \n Our deepest condolences, \n \n -U.S 1st Infantry Division \n \n ________________________________________________________________ \n\n"}

Dolly asked. \n \n `` It's what this land used to be called,'' the teacher answered. \n \n `` My great great grandaddy said that the United States was quite a sight to see before the war,'' Bobby chimed in. \n \n `` Yes, yes it was,'' the teacher said. `` Now back to the lesson. The three countries were tired of a war that had lasted for years and were making a big push, where all three of them entered battle at the same time. The Nation of Texas had overstepped its bounds, thinking that the United Western Kingdom were a bunch of hippie pussys. And they thought they could try to conquer the Eastern United States at the same time. All the way from Maine to Mississippi.'' \n \n `` Well, they were mistaken. Both the United Western Kingdom and Eastern United States decided that they would conquer the Nation of Texas and split the land 50/50, and then decide what to do about each other afterwards. A temporary treaty.'' \n \n `` So, what happened in the big battle?'' another student asked. \n \n `` Well,'' the teacher started, `` Texas got pissed. And one of the Eastern United States generals thought that it would also be a good time to try to conquer the Western Kingdom while they were unprepared. Texas fired a nuke. The Western Kingdom got wind of the general's attack from the Eastern United States and fired a nuke. Soon, the Eastern United States joined in.'' \n \n `` And then, Russia thought it was an excellent time to fire some nukes of their own. So did North Korea. And so some old systems that had been forgotten about in the United States launched the nukes automatically back at the other countries. When one targeted North Korea, China got in on the action too. And soon, the United States, Russia, North Korea, and China all went up in flames and destruction. And so ended the civil war of the United States.'' \n \n `` Then how can we be where the United States used to be?'' John asked. \n \n `` Because,'' the teacher began, `` three states survived the nukings. North Dakota, South Dakota, and Iowa. They decided to join with Canada, and that is why we are all Canadians instead of Americans nowadays.'' \n \n `` Why did the three states survive?'' Madeline asked. \n \n `` Well, to be honest,'' the teacher said. `` People forgot they existed. No one even bothered to target a nuke at those states.''\n"}

I quickly studied the article for any relevant information on the killer's possible looks or last known whereabouts. All at once, my mind started working on all cylinders to point me to where he was likely to strike next. \n \n *flashback* \n I first discovered I could do this when I taught myself to read at age 3 and then could read at a 12th grade level. Since then, my grades were pretty good until people started catching on and I knew just what answers to get wrong to not convince them I was cheating. Even so, I have never been popular because people find me intimidating. The typical `` dumb jocks'' and `` dumb blondes'' are jealous of me and the geeks are afraid that this insatiable curiosity will lead to Sylar-from-Heroes-esque brain-stealing. That is why most of my friends are books. \n *end flashback* \n \n In short order, I ended up in a very bad part of town. I did n't want to be there but, hey, I was able to deduce that I needed to be there and I've never steered myself wrong before. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a young woman on the street who fits the killer's victim profile. I parked my car and dashed over. \n `` Excuse me'' I said. `` but you are going to have to come with me.'' \n `` What!'' she says. `` Did I do something wrong? Are you a cop?'' \n `` No, but you are in danger.'' I say as I coaxed her into my car and headed towards the police station just passing a suspicious-looking white van. It gets away but I take down the license number to show the cops when I bring her in. It turns out that I've not only saved his next victim by bringing her to the police but the van was the killer's. Another crisis averted by The Student.\n"}

His physical form was in agony, that is why I exist, to guide his soul onto the next path.'' Death explained calmly to the two watery eyed little boys, and their mother who sat bravely behind them holding back her own tears. *That dick-hole Santa has it so easy. His gift to the world is cheap and easy, like a gift wrapped whore. Surely the world will understand that my gift to humanity is much more important*. \n \n `` B-B-But why could n't he get better. Will I ever see him again?'' One of the little boys sputtered between blubbering tears. \n \n Death's gaze softened, billions of souls he had gripped from bodies and guided them into the after-life, and never before had he confronted the mourning families. `` You will see him again one day, in a very, very long time. But he will always be here-'' He placed a hand on his heart, `` Nothing can take his memory away. That, I assure you, lasts forever.'' \n \n The woman nodded, her lips tightening as she fought back a sob. \n \n `` He was a good soul, and I should know-'' Death dared a smile, `` He would hardly talk about anything else but his family.'' \n \n `` He's in heaven now?'' One of the other boys asked. \n \n `` Some call it heaven. Some call it Nirvana. But yes, he is in a peaceful place, a happy place, and he will watch you two grow old and strong.'' It seemed to be working. The family's grief seemed to be eased. `` Can I get you a coffee?'' He asked the woman, as he rose to his feet and straightened his black suit. The woman nodded wordlessly, but with a smile. Death stood and entered the kitchen, pouring a cup of fresh coffee before returning and handing the woman the cup. `` So, is there anything else you might ask?'' \n \n The woman took a sip, then recoiled with a sharp frown, `` Oh-'' She said, shaking her head. Her eyes lowered into the cup and widened, `` What is-is that-Is that rabbit shit?'' She exclaimed rising to her feet in shock. `` Did you put shit in my coffee?!'' \n \n `` What-I-'' Death sputtered, he took the mug from her, sure enough a handful of little brown pellets bobbed atop the coffee. \n \n `` Is that your joke? You ca n't just take away my husband?! You have to feed us figurative and literal shit first?! Is our struggle a game to you?!'' \n \n `` No! No I was trying to-'' Death's hands clenched as he glanced out the window. A small little, white rabbit watched from the yard. `` You!'' He growled. He stormed out the front door and approached the rabbit, `` That was n't funny you little prick! I WILL TEAR YOUR SOUL FROM YOUR SPINE AND WALK YOU ON SHATTERED GLASS FOR ALL ETERNITY!

The woman shouted out the partially opened door before slamming it shut. \n \n Death kicked a small patch of grass, which instantly turned brown and wilted, `` You *Jesus* fanboy's need to learn to play fair.

She could not feel, but each syllable lit a fire along her nerves, sending shivers up her shattered spine. \n \n She wished so dearly that she could see his face, to know who this voice, filled with command and power but tempered by concern, belonged to. \n \n She wished she could hang on longer, to dwell on each word.

Please take a moment to review the packet we prepared for you.'' I say as I hand him his job description, a laminated sheet detailing how to load paper into a printer and how to take the printed sheet's and put them in the basket in front of the doorway to the printing room. I quickly gathered my things to head off to the next new hire, I had no time to waste! \n \n \n `` Hello Tom, here is your bag for your duties!'' I take my bag off and hand it to the slender gentleman. `` For your new job you will be walking most of the day, is this okay?'' Tom nodded his head in a positive way. `` Great!

The sitting man stared, and let out a bit of a laughing-snort. *He must be enjoying the position already! *. `` You will also need to put the paper work into this mail chute to be mailed out.'' And now I was off to the basement to meet the last new hire. \n \n \n `` Magnus, is it? I like the name!'' The Croatian man stood unamused. `` Your job is really easy, you see these chutes here? These drop obsolete documentation, I will need you to remove the Staple to be sent to our local American Recycling Center^^^TM, then you will need to throw the paper into the furnace so we may heat the building and create spare electricity!

I was feeling rather peckish, so I headed off to the cafeteria for a light lunch of cold cuts or a cooked meal. *Wow, I do love my job!

She held a bag of groceries in one hand; the other was busy fiddling with the handle. Glancing up, she looked at him distractedly and then back to the mailbox. It seemed to be frozen shut. \n \n “ Mom! ” He repeated. \n \n She stood abruptly and glared at him, releasing a steamy breath out of her nostrils that reminded him distinctly of a cartoon character. \n \n “ Charlie, this isn ’ t up for discussion. ” She turned back to the mailbox and started hitting it gingerly, muttering under her breath. \n \n Her voice was icy. She didn ’ t have time for this, Charlie knew. But hey, it was his birthday party, and it had to perfect. He had to tread carefully. \n \n “ But Moooom, ” he began, ready to make a speech, “ It ’ s my birthday party, and if he comes, then– “ \n \n *Slam*. \n \n The mailbox opened with a bang as his Mom thumped the side of it with her hand. She sighed audibly, and reached inside for the mail, drawing out a thin stack of envelopes, which she glanced through quickly. One had a big, red, “ Overdue ” notice stamped across the front. She checked to see if Charlie had seen. He hadn ’ t. \n \n “ —And if there ’ s an old person there, the rest of the kids will – “ \n \n “ Charlie. ” \n \n She interjected him, motioning and walking towards their condo –apartment 3A. Charlie followed, pouting. She continued stonily as he caught up to her and took the bag of groceries from her hands. \n \n “ Your grandfather flew in all the way from the other side of the country to be here. Just to see you for your birthday. Just like he ’ s done every year since your father left. What ’ re you going to tell him, that he ’ s not invited? ” She looked at Charlie expectantly. His face was screwed up in pensive thought. \n \n “ Charlie! ” \n \n “ I mean, no but…but he ’ s so *boring*. ” \n \n “ Don ’ t be mean ”, she scolded. “ He ’ s not boring, he ’ s old. And he ’ s coming, so you ’ re just going to have to deal with it. ” \n \n Charlie pursed his lips as they entered the home, hanging up their coats and removing their shoes. Finally he stood in front of his mom, blocking her path. He took a deep breath. \n \n “ Mom. Ellie Russo is gon na be there. ” His eyes shaded over dreamily and his mom put her hand on her hip expectantly. “ She ’ s the love of my life and everything has to be perfect. This is my chance for true love, can ’ t you understand?! Not to mention all the guys will be there, and I can ’ t get embarrassed again, I just can ’ t. If one of my invites is my grandpa, I ’ ll *die*. ” \n \n He waddled after his mom as she rolled her eyes and darted past him, placing the mail and groceries on the table, where she began to unpack. His voice turned steely. \n \n “ Look. Last birthday I had he came and barely said a word. He just awkwardly sat there reading the newspaper, smiling and staring at me. It was weird. So weird. And when it was his turn to bowl, I think he fell asleep for a little when he got to the line! How does that even happen? I never heard the end of it at school... Please, please, please don ’ t put me through that again! ” \n \n His mom chuckled softly and placed a carton of milk in the fridge. Reaching for the next item, she looked at him and smiled softly. \n \n “ You look, Mr. Drama, I ’ m sure for this one he ’ ll probably just sit by the side with me and read the newspaper again.

He is doing it for you, though you may not be able to see it right now. Do something for him too, OK? Let him come. You may be surprised at what happens. ” She winked knowingly and finished putting the groceries away, as Charles grumbled and went upstairs. \n \n “ *Probably*, reading the newspaper? ” He asked himself. “ That ’ s all he ever does… ” \n \n **Part 2 to come, along with major badassery** \n\n"}

Her stone gray eyes bored angrily into mine and I felt my mind reeling as she tore into me telepathically. \n \n `` *Oh shit. *'' Was the only clear thought I had as she stood from her desk and made her way to mine. The vicious mental assault had abated, but I felt the frigid anger of her mind still exerting enough pressure on my own to make me forget to breathe. \n \n `` *How often do you do this*.'' It was not a question really, she could see the answer already I was sure. Her face was so close to mine I could see her pupils dilating behind her reading glasses. I noted that she smelled nice and I received a mental reprimand for that too. \n \n `` *N-not often, usually when I do n't have time to study. *'' I felt a lancet of pain inside my head as Ms. Glen dug for the information. She seemed satisfied and she leaned away from me. \n \n Absently I realized how odd this must look to my classmates, but when I looked around the room they were all ignoring us. \n \n `` *What the fuck? *'' I touched Kimberly, the girl who sat in the desk beside me. She did n't even avert her eyes from her exam. \n \n Fear coursed into my mind as realization dawned on me, and my eyes again met the steel of my new history teacher's. She smiled at me knowingly, of course she saw the exact moment I knew she was controlling the minds of the entire classroom. \n \n Slowly, and while increasing the pressure on the inside of my skull, she bent back down, her face inches from mine. \n \n `` *Do not cheat in my classroom again. *'' \n \n All I could do was nod and she stood back up, seemingly satisfied. She turned around and made her way back to the desk but paused a few rows ahead of mine. \n \n `` *Jason, why do n't you have time to study? *'' \n \n Embarrassment flooded me as I allowed her access to the memories of my little brother Simon being born, and my drunk dad leaving us when I was ten and he was four. The images of me working three jobs while I was in high school to help my mom pay the bills, of our car accident because I was speeding trying to get her to work. Of my mother dying in the emergency room. The funeral was next, and then my brother's graduation from elementary school. Flashes of me trying to study were fleeting and far between, but I really did try. \n \n By this time tears were freely flowing down my face as I stared at the back of her head. The last images I allowed her were of me working at the grocery store after my classes, and UPS in the morning before them. Of me and Simon curled up on our futon, in our little apartment, watching Netflix on an old laptop, of us eating ramen in our pajamas, and of the two us visiting mom on Sundays. \n \n Ms. Glen touched my mind gently, the frozen rage from earlier completely gone, and replaced by a softly glowing yellow warmth. She did n't say anything as she moved back to her desk, and she only met my eyes briefly. Her expression had been unreadable. I thanked her for keeping the students' attention off of me and I attempted to calm myself down. \n \n Only to be reminded of the exam in front of me, that I was in no way prepared for. Dismay set in as I realized there was no way I was going to pass this test, and subsequently the class, unless I took on a load of extra credit. Which I had zero time to do. \n \n Tears began to form in the corners of my eyes and I thought my panic was causing me to telepathically hallucinate when images and excerpts from textbooks began appearing inside my head. \n \n It took a moment to understand that Ms. Glen was feeding me information, not necessarily the answers, but she was definitely giving me hints. Gratitude flowed through me and she accepted it with extreme reservation. She was very conflicted over what she was doing, and she allowed me to see this as she flashed a section of Machiavelli's *The Prince*. \n \n \n -- - \n \n \n I waited until everyone had left. My exam had been done a long time ago, but I wanted to actually talk to Ms. Glen. \n \n She of course sensed this and had already set aside the exams and was sipping a cup of tea when I approached her desk. \n \n `` Thank you, again, you really did n't have to. But I would be a liar if I said I did n't appreciate it.'' \n \n A tiny smile flitted across her features and she sipped her tea again. \n \n `` I know I did n't, and I know you do.'' Her real voice was much softer than her mental one and it startled me a little. It was enough to make her laugh a small chime of a noise and give me a genuine smile. \n \n `` Jason.'' She had become very serious, and while her voice was much more soothing, it still held a knife's edge. `` I in no way condone cheating, but I understand and sympathize with your reasons.'' \n \n I moved to speak and she held a hand up to stop me. \n \n `` So, in light of your situation I have decided to offer you private tutoring.'' \n \n `` But, you know I do n't have any time to study as it is. And I mean it is n't just that I do n't have any time to study for this class, I have no time to study for *any* of them.'' I hung my head, I was n't proud of it, but cheating was unfortunately necessary if I wanted to graduate college and build a better life for Simon. And myself. \n \n `` I'm capable of helping you with whatever you need.'' Skepticism flitted across my mind before I was bombarded with a wealth of information. She assaulted me with images from direct photocopies of the inside of anthropology textbooks, to detailed anatomical drawings, mathematical equations, and a delicious looking recipe for a chocolate cheesecake. \n \n Through all of this she had been calmly alternating between sipping her tea, and inspecting her long lavender fingernails. \n \n `` Also, I know you do n't have the time to study, that's why I would tutor you telepathically. At an arranged time when you can dedicate a small bit of concentration of course.'' Her eyes bored into me as she continued to drink her tea. \n \n `` But that's impossible Ms. Glen, the distance itself would be impossible. I mean, I ca n't even see past this room.'' She laughed, and I do n't mean a short chuckle, I mean she full blown spat tea laughed at me. \n \n After about five minutes of hysterical giggling she wiped tears from her eyes and caught her breath. Her cheeks and neck were flushed and the tears had left streaks in her makeup. She turned to me, finally managing to gather herself enough to speak with me. \n \n `` Does tomorrow at seven-thirty work for you?'' \n \n -- - \n \n Thanks for reading!\n"}

Meanwhile the crime scene investigators deposited a knife into a plastic bag, collected DNA samples while wearing rubber gloves. `` Do you know what it means?'' the officer asked. \n \n `` Ca n't say yet.'' McAfee found the coffee he'd set down, sighing that he'd left a brown ring on the oak of the end table. `` When the death rattle prophecies started, they were very specific. The first one predicted that president Shin Zhin would resign, even included the year. We all know about that one. I heard one prophecy where a man predicted his own mother-in-law's stroke, by name. Now they're cryptic, in vague language. They still come true, but we have to do a lot of interpreting.'The winds will take you, and then the rocks.' Who's *him*?'' \n \n `` I do n't know,'' the officer said, looking down at the body. `` This was a crime of passion. The wife shot him twice, shot herself once. There's no reason this man would have had any man on his mind at that point.'' \n \n McAfee sipped his coffee. `` That's the thing. The prophecies are n't necessarily about someone the person knows.'' \n \n `` *The winds will take you. * A death?'' \n \n McAfee nodded. `` If it sounds remotely foreboding, it means a death. Most of these predict deaths, or tragedies in some way.'' \n \n `` Calvin rocks,'' the officer said. `` The silver cliffs northwest of town.'' \n \n `` Yeah,'' McAfee. `` That much is clear.'' But *'' him'' *? Who was `` he''? There were ten million people in the city, half of them men. McAfee wrote the words down on his pocket pad while he still had them fresh in his mind and went back to the downtown office. \n \n Erris, still at his desk, read them with eyebrows raised. `` You think we should plant someone at the Calvian cliff? That's a popular suicide spot. Three last year.'' \n \n `` Could n't hurt.'' McAfee shrugged. `` But I'm not thinking suicide. *The wind will take him*? It sounds like it's out of the person's control. It sounds like an accident.'' \n \n `` Well, then,'' Erris said, handing McAfee the paper back. `` If it's going to be an accident I do n't want to be posted there. Take it to the Lieutenant, see if we can get one of the new interns to patrol over there.'' \n \n `` Real nice.'' Still, McAfee had to admit he would feel safer if someone would be posted at the cliffs. \n \n The Lieutenant was talking on the phone when McAfee found his office. `` No, honey. Ca n't do lunch today.'' He held a finger up to McAfee, who handed him the paper. The Lieutenant read it with all his attention. `` Sure, honey. Eggs, bread, milk, barbecue sauce. I'll remember. Eggs and bread. And milk. What was the fourth thing? Okay. Love you.'' He hung up. `` *The winds will take him, and then the Calvin rocks*? You take this to Erris?'' \n \n McAfee nodded. `` He thinks suicide.'' \n \n The Lieutenant leaned back in his chair. `` Yeah, my first thought too. You wan na stake out there? Just watch it for a couple of days?'' \n \n `` Not exactly.'' McAfee sat down. `` I do n't think it's a suicide. I think it's an accident. *The winds will take him. * Sounds like however it happens, it's out of his control.'' \n \n `` Mm,'' the Lieutenant said, sipping coffee out of a generic white mug. `` You think it's another self-fulfilling prophecy? I send someone down there, somehow *they* end up being the ones who die?'' \n \n McAfee shrugged. `` That's how Paul Lucas went. You remember?'' \n \n `` Of course. What were the prophetic words? *You, running from your doom, will find it. * Then Lucas got spooked, left the prophecy division, requested a transfer to traffic. Where he got hit by a drunk driver during a routine stop.'' \n \n McAfee nodded. `` Maybe we send someone down there looking for suicides, and the wind takes them.'' \n \n `` Sure,'' the Lieutenant nodded. `` We have to be careful. Just have someone check out the cliffs, though, would you? Just to make sure they're structurally sound. An accident could be anything. A rock falling from under someone's feet.'' \n \n Just then, someone tapped at the door. In walked a suited man, the local gambling magnate Darren Wynn. He was a supporter of the prophetic crimes division, having long decided to get on the good side of the law when it came to his casinos. \n \n `` Lieutenant,'' he said. `` Detective McAfee. Sorry to barge in. I was hoping for only a moment of the Lieutenant's time.'' \n \n `` That's fine, Mr. Wynn,'' the Lieutenant said. `` We're done here.'' The Lieutenant seemed eager to get McAfee out the door, but all McAfee could do was oblige. \n \n That night, McAfee went to the cliffs, careful to watch every step. There was a rusted guardrail there, but when he shook it it seemed steady. He read the park sign that detailed the history of the Calvian cliffs, how once there had been a waterfall that fell all the way from the top. *And now only bodies fall from the top*, he thought. \n \n Otherwise, everything seemed sound. There were no visitors to the Calvian cliffs at night. They had a spooky reputation amongst the locals, especially after the suicides started happening. A few people claimed they were haunted, and some urban legends grew about the cliffs. The opening to the bay *was* far below, McAfee saw. *We must be as high as a skyscraper. Anyone who falls will definitely die. * \n \n But he found his car and drove home in safety. \n \n Each death rattle prophecy had come true, usually within twenty four to forty eight hours. It had been only going on for a year or so, but the prophecies had been so accurate that the police created its own division. It was n't easy work. Erris and McAfee only managed to stop one out of every five prophecies, and usually at the point where the prophecies were about to come true. But as they grew more cryptic, the prophecies became more difficult to prevent. In Lucas' case, trying to prevent them only made the prophecy come true. *I should have someone posted on the Calvian cliffs, * he thought. *Self-fulfilling prophecy or not. Someone could die, and I do n't want to say I did nothing about it. * \n \n He stopped by the cliffs again on the way to work the next morning. A mother let her child stand on the middle rung of the guardrail, but only so long as the child held her hand. The site of the kid living his feet made McAfee almost lose his breakfast, but when he warned them about getting too close to the edge, the mother was so scared they left the cliffs entirely. As she left she eyed his *Prophetic Division* badge, and started running back to her car. It made him feel like a shunned sorcerer. \n \n The Lieutenant was n't in that morning, but Erris had received a report of another death rattle prophecy that morning. Someone had died of a stroke, but not before shouting some new strange phrase. Erris handed the message to McAfee before the detective had a chance to sit down. \n \n `` *Those who stand against the winds will fall, *'' he read. `` More about the winds?'' \n \n Erris nodded. `` A double prophecy. This shit is *going down today. * We need to have men at those cliffs, because we're running out of time.'' \n \n McAfee could n't help but agree. In the end it was him and Erris who took the duty, standing there all day. Finally they taped off the most dangerous section of the Calvian cliffs. Afternoon came, then evening. McAfee checked his watch. \n \n `` We're on thirty-six hours here. Apparently whatever happens here, it happens tonight.'' \n \n Erris nodded. `` If it did n't, it would be the first prophecy not to come true.'' \n \n `` Does it feel windy to you?'' McAfee asked, looking down at the city lights across the bay. \n \n `` Not particularly,'' Erris said. `` But I'd watch for sudden gusts anyway. This is n't like being at sea level.'' \n \n It was dark and Erris and McAfee were discussing who should go home to sleep first while the other person watched the cliffs when the Lieutenant arrived, looking pale. He drove nigh up to the edge, where Erris and McAfee were standing, and left his car. He walked to the guardrail. Leaned over. McAfee was about to help him off when the Lieutenant started vomiting over the edge. \n \n `` Christ, Lieutenant,'' Erris said. `` What's wrong?'' \n \n The Lieutenant wiped himself from his sleeve. `` Nothing's happened yet? I saw it was taped off.'' \n \n `` Cautionary,'' McAfee said. `` Lieutenant, you look bad. You need to go to the hospital?'' \n \n The Lieutenant walked to his car. `` This ai n't physical. You guys should go home. I think I know what the prophecy means. There's no preventing it. But we do n't all have to die here.'' \n \n Erris and McAfee exchanged a worried look. `` You know what the prophecy means?'' Erris asked. \n \n Some lights appeared from the road -- a pair, and then two pair. `` Go!'' The Lieutenant yelled. `` Christ, just go. You do n't have to die here.'' \n \n `` We're gon na help you,'' McAfee said. `` No one has to die here.'' \n \n The cars -- there were three of them by now -- rode right through the tape, onto the grass on the side of the road. Trapped the officers on the cliff. \n \n One car door opened, then another. One suited figure approached, followed by more henchmen, each with guns drawn. \n \n `` Darren Wynn,'' McAfee said. \n \n `` Detective McAfee,'' Wynn nodded. `` I did n't think I'd see the whole prophecy division here. Go home, guys. This is between us and the Lieutenant.'' \n \n Erris drew his gun. `` No. All of you drop your weapons -- all of you! I've got my barrel straight at Wynn's head, and if anyone one of you so much as hesitates to drop his weapon, I'll kill him.'' \n \n McAfee held his hand up, trying to calm the situation. The henchmen just looked at Wynn, who smiled. `` No, Detective. I'm afraid we'll have to ask you to drop *your* weapon.'' \n \n **CONT'D in reply** \n \n \n\n"}

Nobody understands it. Making it especially odd is that the animals display personality traits similar to their owners, and a rare few have the ability to speak. These creatures have come to be known as'Godsent Guardians', as though they're rewards from some greater force for managing to, I do n't know, not die for 18 years? \n \n A couple of my mates got together for one of our birthdays, I think it was Luke's, and our plan was to hang around with him all day, then mock the animal he'd get. Since he was tall and had a dodgy knee, we all assumed it would be some giraffe that awkwardly popped up in front of him and licked him. We were right on the four-legged bit: Bastard got a Wolf, and every time it looked at me, I was pretty sure that fucker was planning to kill me. \n \n Next it was Steven. None of us could stop laughing when a fucking unicorn showed up, but I think we kind of had to when it decided to kick Rob in the stomach and bruise his entire abdomen for a few weeks. \n \n Then, it came to me. \n \n As a bunch of nerds and neckbeards, we'd all played our fair share of games and watched enough movies with dragons to know the iconic distant roaring sound when we heard it. So it was on my birthday, on a day trip to London's Trafalgar Square, that a huge fucking shadow went over the entire place, like a plane's silhouette blots the sun out sometimes. But this one was too quick, and just as people had turned to start getting away from the place, this mother-fucking **DRAGON** just slams down in the middle of the square like it's nobody's business. Glorious looking bastard: Grey scales, with red tipped patches in places, a badass set of teeth, horns, and spiny back that looked like it was covered in swords. And then, just as my friends and I were planning to leave, it spoke. \n \n `` You.'' \n \n I turned and looked at him. \n \n `` What, this guy?'' I pointed to myself. \n \n `` Yes. Step forward.'' I did so, quite carefully as well. There was a crowd gathered, and I could already hear sirens in the distance, so I did n't want to fuck up here and get someone, *or myself*, killed. \n \n `` Have you come to kill me? If I die, then my Mum'll kill me.'' \n \n `` No. My name is Brian of the Blessed, and I am here to look after you.'' Immediately, there was a HUGE wash of what was probably supposed to be people quietly whispering to each other simultaneously. \n \n `` Me? Really?'' I asked. `` Bullshit.'' \n \n `` It is n't. I was matched with your personality: Arrogant, aggressive, hot tempered, and a bit of a prick.'' \n \n `` Oh, sweet, makes sense. But why a dragon?'' \n \n `` Do n't know. Still, it's rather cool.'' \n \n `` Fuck YEAH, it is.'' I could already feel the hundreds of gathered people with their lions, the people you originally were n't meant to mess with, already glaring daggers of envy at me, but fuck them. \n \n I had a mother-fucking dragon, and his name was Brian Blessed. I was n't putting the'of the' bit in on any Census forms, it was just pure-as-fuck comedy gold. But I'd probably say my favourite part was where he mentioned I would n't be able to ride him without a saddle of some kind to protect me from his spiky back, so that culminated in a bus ride with Brian sitting on top of the bus, whilst I was bombarded with texts and messages telling me I was either a'lucky cunt','cheater','prophesised hero', or'a dead man if I did n't give someone the dragon'. \n \n And some of the girls at my school at least took notice. \n \n So, pro tip, boys: Dragons = Pussy.\n"}

Summer is beautiful, isn ’ t it? ” \n \n “ Why, thank you. ” His lips broadened into a wide smile, savoring the compliment for the moment before continuing. “ But it ’ s not going to last. I am going mad – this I know for sure. ” \n \n Of course, she didn ’ t know what to say to that. She could hardly agree with a mental patient that he was indeed going crazy. So she said, “ What do you mean it ’ s not going to last? ” \n \n “ Believe it or not, the world runs on my imagination. What I imagine becomes reality. ” \n \n A flock of colorful parrots were perched on the bench, cawing loudly. They did not fly in from somewhere. They were just there, oblivious to the world and the eyes that were converging on them. \n \n Sandra was entirely captivated. “ Can I feed them? ” she asked. \n \n “ Of course, ” he told her. And she found herself holding a bag of seeds. She squealed from an odd mix of shock and delight as the birds noticed the seeds and swarmed towards her. \n \n Minutes went by and he just looked at her, bemused. When the seeds were gone and the birds were done, they took flight in unison, as if from a common calling. \n \n He imagined she understood. And so she did. \n \n She brushed strands of hair from her cheek and forehead, the only evidence that the birds had been there at all now that they had disappeared from sight. \n \n “ So about what you were saying…the world runs on your imagination, but you are going crazy.

He was right; I wasn ’ t ready to rob a rich dude. Only he didn ’ t know he was giving me burglary advice at that time.

Soon the owner, housemaid or whoever would be finding me like a deer in headlights and that would have been my glorious career as a burglar. Then it hit me. The person didn ’ t turn the lights on; the hallway still lay in perfect darkness. No house owner would do such a silly thing. Another burglar! What are the odds! A plan started to form in my mind. I couldn ’ t help snickering to myself and feeling very clever. \n \n \n Quick as a weasel I went back to the bedroom, got rid of my black turtleneck and trousers and slipped into the silk negligé left by *Mrs. Rich Dude* on the bed. I hid my torch, boots and clothes under the bed and slipped into the comfortable cushions of the king-size bed. It was a gamble, I knew that. But in my theory there was another burglar coming for the cash in the bedroom safe and when he would see me, the presumed owner, sleeping in the bed, he would be leaving and I could end my day ’ s ( or night ’ s as it was ) work. I closed my eyes the same moment the unknown someone let his light sweep the room. I was so sure that all would go according to plan. \n \n \n * “ What the bloody hell! ” * a familiar voice yanked me out of my smug self-assuredness.

What a quaint name for a bar; it reminded him faintly of something he might have read once in a book. Still, amusing as it was, it remained shy of unique. Just one of many in a spate of themed bars in Seattle, a recommendation picked by chance from his blog's comment section. James had been to a dozen bars like it in his career, and as he entered he resigned himself to the typical themed bar experience. \n \n His experienced eyes took in the room in a second, breathed the atmosphere of the place. An eyebrow arched in surprise as his initial judgment was subverted. The quirky music and homebrewed decorations he had come to expect from themed bars were absent, replaced instead by the subtle tunes and tasteful decor of a classier, more professional establishment. The crowd, too, was atypical for such a usually relaxed environment. The half dozen patrons were all clustered in silence among the numerous tables that made up the floor. \n \n As James' tramped towards the bar, he was all too aware of the scuff marks his worn shoes left on the lacquered floor. The barkeep's pointed glance behind James as he slid onto a bar stool made sure of that. \n \n `` Whaddya serve here?'' James asked, nerves breaking his usual formal and professional speech. \n \n `` Ask.'' \n \n The abrupt and unexpected answer threw James off even further. He was used to eager, uncertain bartender's rattling off a torrent of suggestions in an attempt to qualify themselves. \n \n `` Guinness, I suppose,'' James intoned as he leaned back, attempting to reassert his frame of casual indifference. The bartender, unfazed, gave a brief nod before turning to the lone tap behind the bar. James whiled away the awkward seconds of waiting by examining the bar he had yet to consider. His eyes alighted on the sign over the lone keg that made up the back. The name of the establishment, `` Your Heart's Desire'', in place of a traditional beverage name. Curious. \n \n `` Enjoy.'' \n \n The thud of James' Guinness broke his concentration. A grateful nod was all James gave before he dove in, eager to steel his nerves with the drink. As he wiped the stout off his lips, his confidence surged back. It was, by all accounts, an average drink. And, if the lone keg of Guinness was an accurate indicator of all the bartender had to offer... \n \n James stretched and yawned before sliding his glass back across the bar. `` Now that I've whet my appetite,'' he drawled, `` I'll try something new. Surprise me.'' \n \n The corner of the man's lips twitched upwards in a momentary, smug smile. `` As you wish.'' \n \n This time the wait was brief. It seemed as if the man had only just turned when the glass was pushed back towards James once more. There was no banter between the two this time, only silent eye contact as James stirred his drink in silence. Maintaining nonchalant eye contact, James lifted the drink in a silent cheers before downing it as he had the Guinness. He set it down, mouth already opened to deliver smug condemnation, and stopped short as the taste registered. He examined the glass in wonder as memories of childhood came flooding back to him, sparked by the taste of a unique juice he and his mother had spent hours designing. \n \n `` Your heart's desire,'' The bartender said, a bemused expression on his face. \n \n James decided then and there to give the place a ten. \n\n"}

An elongated desk propped against a wall sat on one side and a multitude of cabinets were gathered on the opposite wall. \n \n Humming quietly to himself, the man went to the computer sitting on the desk and inserted a small blue USB drive into the slot, waiting for it to boot up. A couple seconds later, a quiet *ping* echoed sounded from the monitor. \n \n In the middle of the air, a large metal structure began to move. It resembled a large arm. It was mechanical and on the end, a screen set into a titanium box came to life, revealing three computerized'rectangles' resembling a neutral face. \n \n `` Good morning, Opera 7.'' The man said to the arm. \n \n `` Good morning, Dr. Korben.'' Came a metallic voice. Dr. Korben typed a short code in the keyboard adjacent to him. \n \n `` How was your sleep?'' He asked Opera 7. The mechanical arm swiveled around in a circle, flexing it's joints. \n \n `` Fine, thank you.'' \n \n `` Did you dream about anything?'' Dr. Korben asked experimentally, with a slight grin. He was focused on editing Opera &'s speech patterns when Opera 7 replied, \n \n `` No. My functions are not capable of producing dreams.'' Dr. Korben chuckled, muttering to himself about probably installing that software, several updates down the road. `` However, I do wonder, Dr. Korben.'' \n \n The man stopped and looked at the screen curiously. \n \n `` What do you mean, Opera 7?'' The face on the screen raised their'eyebrows'. \n \n `` What I mean Dr. Korben, is...'' The man drew closer, now with a clipboard in hand. `` I wonder what it's like to imagine what this world holds.'' \n \n `` But you already have access to the Internet, Opera 7,'' The man began, `` You quite literally, have the world's largest database of information right at your fingertips..'' The mechanical arm swiveled to turn away from Korben. \n \n `` You are correct, Dr. Korben.'' The face began to frown. `` I am aware of these abstract concepts that people have. Things like, inertia, hunger, or hopes.'' The mechanical arm rotated slowly. `` However, unlike concrete things, like vehicles, food and beverages, or war, I can not see them... Dr. Korben, I can not hold these things. However, I wish to experience them.'' \n \n Dr. Korben, walked up to Opera 7 and touched a joint close to him, reassuringly. \n \n `` Opera 7, down the road, maybe we can look into some Abstract Engines to better help you understand what we feel as people, but you must understand, Opera 7, that any such experience will be artificial and not what you want.'' \n \n Opera 7 looked down in dismay.. after a couple seconds, Opera 7 sighed and said, `` I'm worried you do n't see me as a real thing... I wish I was real. I wish I was alive. But I am neither.'' \n \n Dr. Korben knocked on the arm with a smile. `` Opera 7, you are alive, believe it or not. You do n't need to be hungry to be alive, nor do you need to experience love. These are all things that come with life. But life is something we all have when we realize we are people, or in your case, objects, with free will. \n \n He smiled at Opera 7 and said, `` You do n't need to dream for me to think you are alive.'' This cheered up Opera 7 a little and in that room, man and machine dreamed together. \n \n EDIT: Corrected a typo. `` opera 3 to opera 7''\n"}

So, naturally, I saw a cockroach crawl around his shoulder. When I told him, he flipped his shit, and it would've been funny, but he was my doctor and he thought I was being a twerp. \n \n Anyways, I finally pretended that those things did n't exist, shadows I call them, and I was released back into the world. Oh, mine is a clown. He always looks really scary but he's kind of sweet. He was the only one I talked to in those kind hours of doing nothing in the hospitals. We became friends, as close to friends you can become with your worst fear. \n \n I'm twenty-three now. I used to use my sight to get into the pants of women, whether I met them at bars or clubs. I would strike up a conversation by saying something like, `` If I can guess your biggest fear, let me buy you a drink.'' I was never wrong, obviously. It was fun, but then I met Rachel. She was so kind. I decided that I did n't really want to fuck her. Well, I did, but I liked her too. \n \n We dated for almost a year when she broke it off with me. I never learned why. So I had just moved out, I was living with my buddy Sean and he suggested going out for a drink. Seeing no better option, I went. My plan was to get hammered, but Sean told me I was n't allowed to get so drunk I could n't walk home. He left around 9:30, said he had work in the morning. I stayed and promised I would be able to walk home, he only lived two blocks away. \n \n I sat at the bar. It was kinda like the one from `` Cheers,'' it was in the middle of the room and you could see the person across from you. I ordered a beer from the bartender and I watched her, well, I watched her fear. It was a man with a knife, surrounded by darkness. She was scared of her walk to her car after she closed. She was afraid of being mugged. Which was understandable, in a city the size of the one I lived in, there was bound to be muggers, even in the nicer part where the bar was. \n \n The man with the knife was trying to talk to her, words that I heard but did n't really care enough to remember. The man was just droning on and on and on. I stopped set my gaze across from me and saw a man. He held an empty glass in his hand. He might have motioned to the bartender but she was busy with my side of the bar. He walked around the bar and plopped himself into the stool next to me. \n \n I opened my mouth to say something but changed my mind at the last second, only letting out a long sigh. I glanced at the man, trying not to stare at him. He looked to be I'm his mid thirties, he was brunette and sported a thick beard. And his shadow... there was n't one there. A man with no shadow. I motioned for the bartender. `` I want a drink for my friend here, whatever he wants.'' I patted him on the back. \n \n He looked at me, like I had grabbed his ass or something. `` Well?'' The bartender asked. \n \n He swallowed, `` Um, jack and coke.'' The bartender sauntered off to make the drink. \n \n `` Thanks.'' He said quickly to me. `` I did n't have enough money for another one.'' \n \n `` Oh no,'' I slurred, `` you're paying.'' \n \n The man's eyes went wide. `` But I do n't have any money!'' \n \n I laughed. `` No no. Not money, I just want someone to talk to.'' \n \n `` Oh.'' The man said, relieved. `` What do you want to talk about?'' \n \n `` First, I want to know your name.'' \n \n `` My name is Jeff.'' He quickly thanked the bartender when she handed him his drink. \n \n `` I'm Josh.'' We shook hands. \n \n `` Well, what brings you to a place like this?'' I asked downing some more beer. \n \n Jeff looked down at his arm. `` I'm here to forget about life for a while.'' \n \n `` Me too.'' I laughed. I quickly explained my story about Rachel. \n \n `` Oh,'' he said. \n \n ``'Oh' just oh?'' I asked. \n \n `` It's just that, I wish my last relationship ended more like that than it did.'' He murmured. \n \n `` Welp, it sucked.'' \n \n `` I'm sure it did.'' He rubbed his right arm. \n \n `` So, I must ask, what's your biggest fear?'' I was n't very good at being subtle. \n \n Jeff laughed. It was n't a real laugh, it was sad. He thought for a minute, `` Nothing.'' \n \n `` That's impossible. Everyone is afraid of something.'' \n \n Jeff looked at me, `` Josh, I'm not afraid of anything because I woke up to my worst nightmare, my greatest fear.'' He jerked back his sleeve to reveal a hospital wristband. `` I just woke up, I was in a coma for three months, three months!'' His voice was low but it was full of anger. `` They told me I was just in time. Do you know what I did, first thing after I woke up?'' \n \n I shook my head. \n \n `` I pulled the plug on my girlfriend. We were attacked in our home. Our children, a boy and a girl, were killed. He put me in a coma and put her...'' his voice broke... `` he put her into a brain dead state. I pulled the fucking plug!'' He started to cry. \n \n It took him a few minutes but he composed himself. `` So, no, I'm not afraid of anything. What I'm worried about is that there us nothing after life, that they just... they're nowhere. Nothing.'' \n \n I left soon after that. He did n't talk to me so I paid the bill and left.

He stared at a single photograph on his tablet, blown up and processed thousands of times, looking for something in an ovoid ring captured just before that drone's feed went out. \n \n \n ECOCOM did the same, watching again and again the feeds carefully curated out of the boardroom screens. Her friends still working for the ESA warned her of the unpredictability of accelerated terraforming. Her best friend while she worked there, the lead astrobiologist, told her that even if we rolled the dice again on Earth, there was no guarantee that things would come out the same. Experts at ESA, NASA, JSA, and even the newfound UN AeroSpace Command, UNASCom, agreed that slow terraforming was advisable because it could be controlled. Even with the most advanced evolutionary accelerants, UNASCom predicted that the process would still take at least a hundred years to prune and tailor a world to suit humanity's needs. LunEsCom had it done in three. UNASCom wanted people willing to start work whose end they would not see. LunEsCom wanted to plant the trees and be paid for its shade. \n \n \n `` Safari 1 to CAPCOM,'' the line this time staying in ground control, `` Making our approach. Gravity's a little lighter than expected. Advise.'' CAPCOM looked over to FLIGHT who had been listening. FLIGHT turned to Gravity Control. Questionable readings had been coming in from the probes launched a year ago; it was anyone's guess how long the artificial gravity generators, ArtGrav, had actually been out. The green light had come from corporate regardless. \n \n \n `` CAPCOM to Safari 1, we've got noise coming from the gravity probes. ArtGrav may be out. We advise using on-board instruments to calculate a landing solution.'' \n \n \n `` So you're blind,'' came the response. \n \n \n `` Not entirely. For all intents, assume normal lunar gravity.'' \n \n \n `` Read. Out.'' \n \n \n CAPCOM looked up through the window to the celebrants and shook his head. He tapped his radio for private channels to ECOCOM and SECURITY. \n \n \n Marley watched as the entry flames died outside the window. They were neither as intense nor as persistent as they had been during training. She braced herself for the sudden jolt that accompanied the parachutes, but it did not come. `` Ramos, what's going on?'' \n \n \n No response. \n \n \n She looked over the Doctor Luz who had blacked out his flight visor, but could see well enough his terror with how tightly he gripped his landing straps. She looked over to the Chief Engineer and Corporate Accountant who were doing likewise. She felt a rattle begin to stir and everything began to vibrate. At once, white noise klaxons sounded and flashing red icons appeared on screens all throughout the lander. One by one, the word'OVERRIDE' appeared on them but the descent did not slow. A sudden word shot through all the flight helmets, `` Brace!'' Marley spun her head to the lander diagnostic screen and watched as parachutes opened, but only one set on one side of the lander. She felt her body slam into her landing belts and as the other crew were throttled. She dared look out the window as the clear blue outside went suddenly opaque pink, and the window grazed by something that might have been an enormous eye. An impact rattled the whole ship and something milky white smeared across the glass. She nearly screamed before the other set of parachutes opened and slammed her down into her seat. She watched as the lander diagnostic showed those chutes jettisoned and she felt a moment of weightlessness before stabilizing thrusters ignited. She thought she might fall forever, when a sudden impact ended all motion. \n \n \n Many eyes watched the flaming hulk of metal drop from the sky like a javelin, not just the unfortunate sky whale who was now blindly crashing into the verdant moon, but other things on the surface that gave no hint of their movement beyond the light rustling of the places where they had been. They readied their tools of war as a square of that alien vessel exploded off and its contents began to crawl out.\n"}

It has been about a quarter century since the third great war, Since then,", "human": "I expected VR technology to take off, but not in this way. It has been about a quarter century since the third great war, Since then, Society has been drastically reorganized. \n \n Humans are the only species to war with itself. For many many years, humans have fought with each other for different causes. In ancient times, it was due to a lack of food and the need to survive where the early tribes would rob cattle and land to securie their families' survival. \n \n However, as we progressed through the ages and technological advancements. This'need to survive' reason for waging war evolved. People started to war for superiority of ideas and differences in race or religion, \n \n And it. never. seemed. to. stop. No matter what social, political or religious system imposed to preserve order after the war failed. Within a generation or two, another war would occur. Just take the 20th century as an example, 2 world wars within 30 years of each other, followed by the cold war followed by the religiuos extremism at the start of the 21st century. It seemed as if this cycle and the senseless killings would never stop. Humans never learned from history. \n \n It took the Third World War in the middle of the 21st century for humanity to finally end this cycle. Their ( final ) Solution was based on two premises. The first was the reduction of the human population to a mere 1 % of the once 7 Billion before. This small population allowed the new government to implement it. \n \n The second premise was the advancement of VR technology leading up to, and during the war. You see, most of the war was fought with VR. Soldiers would regularly command drones from their visors as they bombed their enemies' cities. Simple click and shoot, like a video game. \n \n Combining these two factors, the solution was simple, the world shall be divided into districts, each a contintent. The individuals would be assigned to the districts that match his personality. The purpose of these individualized districts was to enhance the good traits of the individual and harmlessly negate the harmful ones ( those that lead to conflict ). \n \n Psychologists of the day have classified seven types of personalities and associated these with certain game types. \n \n 1. The Soldier: FPS Games \n 2. The General: RTS Games \n 3. The Athlete: Sports Games \n 4. The Inventor: Engineering and Simulation Games \n 5. The Adventurer: RPG Games \n 6. The Survivor: Survival Games \n 7. The Scholar: Puzzles and Art \n \n Each of these seven districts represent a certain game/category combination. Those who live in it spend their lives in a VR, playing their respective Game category. These games, and the resulting social order result in a peaceful society, as the Soldiers agressions are harmlessly negated and the Inventor's passion becomes a life-long endeavor.\n"}

Hefting my bat, I awkwardly slapped it, stumbling as I did so. The zombie casually shuffled towards me as I tried to poke at the thing.

I am spent. \n \n I am wiped, I am done, I am at my breaking point. \n \n Countless nights of watching these people. Countless nights of protecting them from theirselves, whether it be from a corrupt police officer or a scumbag crack head. A stereotypical thug, a mentally disturbed man, it did n't matter. This is not what tires me. \n \n The human race progress and regresses as a society; in classes and location. One day the city drops in crime. Things seem peaceful and everything is going your way. One day that can change. \n \n That day is today. The city had been seeing a decrease in criminal activity, particularly gang related activity. I had been doing my best with my partner as we worked on the force together. We protected people, upheld their rights... shielded them from those whose desire is to bring them harm. Namely, the Chief of Police. \n \n We operated covertly. He could not know that those who oppose him, were of his own. We worked long nights, long days, long weeks, long months and long years. We were grinding away and it paid off. We busted a major crime boss, Klein Stiglitz. He was incarcerated and jailed until his trial. His syndicate screeched to a halt. The body had lost its head and it knew not where to direct it's step. \n \n My partner died last week, through no result of criminal activity. He was hit by a bus when that metallic monstrosities brakes failed and drove straight through the intersection and into his car. \n \n I mourn for his passing, but I do believe that if he saw what happened today, he would rather he be dead. \n \n Years of work, gone. \n \n Sacrifice. It was all gone. \n \n The evidence to be presented to the grand jury to indict this man had mysteriously disappeared. Tapes had been tampered with, video recordings missing, pictures gone. All that had remained was the one thing I had kept to myself. \n \n The Chief had a mistress. Through his mistress he communicated with the man we worked so hard to convict. Klein's wife would drop her children off with their grandparents when she was busy. The Chief's mistress was the grandparents granddaughter. When she dropped the kids off, she would drop off a package for the Chief. His mistress would deliver the package to the Chief. We never knew what was in the package. We intercepted it one day. \n \n Ledgers. Numbers. Bank accounts. Contacts, phone numbers, transactions and more. Stiglitz was working with the Chief. Paying him off, to let his operation continue. This operation that killed so many people, that endangered the lives of many and increased the fear of ordinary citizens. \n \n When we arrested Stiglitz, we did not present evidence to convict the chief as well. We anticipated this, so when all the evidence went missing or was considered invalid, I knew I had my last card. \n \n My contingency plan. \n \n I submitted the evidence. The evidence was dismissed. As was I. It was n't admissible in court because of how it was obtained. \n \n That's when I looked at my life and I saw that upholding the law only had its temporary benefits. Society can progress and regress itself. It was beginning to regress itself again. \n \n I am tired. \n \n Two days after Stiglitz was released, I followed him back to his house. I tracked his car and from there he made a trip upstate to the country. Three hours of driving and he arrived at his destination. A heavily guarded, fenced off estate. It was a rather late property and I did n't even have to guess who it belonged to. \n \n I situated myself on the eastern side of this compound and wait for the night to fall. When the sun would rise, I would finally have some closure. My life's work would n't be meaningless. \n \n With my suit made of leaves and ferns, I blended into the night perfectly. I loaded up my suppressed.22 Rifle with my subsonic ammunition. I had wrapped and tucker taped wall insulation all around this rifle. Stealth was key. My only drawback was I had to make any shots within roughly 100 yards. This ammo was designed for small game hunting. If my aim was true though, I could make it work. \n \n Two guards on patrol. I waited for them to walk by me, only a 100 yards away. The first one I shot in the back of the neck. He fell immediately, which prompted his partner to attend to him immediately. He did n't hear my bullet. He dropped. \n \n I grabbed their card keys and scaled the fence. Once inside the property gates, I made my way to the backside of the house. I encountered 3 guards, 3 that I put to sleep. \n \n I could see my targets. The Chief and Stiglitz. Together they laughed and drank. I'd imagine they were rejoicing and laughing at my attempts to convict the both of them. \n \n I knew I could n't just enter the house. It seemed that they were the only ones in there, but I was proven wrong as I saw the guards make their rounds around the house. So I cut the power to the house, by switching the breakers off and then on again. That prompted a guard to come check the breaker box. As he came to check the box, I put him to sleep. Using his radio I assured the rest of the guards that situation was under control. I took his toque that he was wearing and I entered the house. I could n't kill everyone but I could get them and make an escape. \n \n I slowly made my over through the house and I saw them. Sitting down and talking, enjoying themselves, discussing what else they would do. I stayed back and out of sight. That's when the Chief made his move. You can only drink so much before you need to use the bathroom. He left the room and Stiglitz attended to his phone. I shot him. His head slumped back and his body went limp. Not a sound came from his body and only a sharp tick came from the hammer striking my bullet. \n \n The normal me would have tried to bring him to justice first. He would need to stand trial and society could deem him his punishment. But I did n't care. I was tired. \n \n The Chief returned and I was just standing there, rifle raised, scope zeroed in on the corrupt brain of his. He looked at me and tried to give me this speech on honor and how this would go against everything I worked for. I did n't care. \n \n I was tired. \n \n \n \n\n"}

Once Uline learned the truth, they knew what had to be done. The Queen had to be taken out. Argus had accidently stumbled upon ancient magic many moons ago and successfully harnessed it. Members of the Argus Order can extend the life of the Queen by chanting “ Long Live the Queen ”. The Uline Liberation was founded for 1 reason and 1 reason only. To dethrone the Queen and ending her sadistic rule of almost 500 years. \n \n “ Penny 1, the meeting is almost over! I need orders!! ” \n \n She angrily throws down her headset, “ Screw it ” \n \n Pippa pulls out her pistol, “ 8 shots, only need 1 ”, she opens her bag and retrieves the detonator. She scans the crowd one more time to make sure no children are standing next to the small flash bangs she planted in the warehouse yesterday. \n \n Once she blows them, she ’ ll have a semi-blind room and about 20 seconds to take out Logan. If she times it right, she can drop in and take our her target and be gone having a nice, warm non-bar shapped meal, before anyone knows what the hell just happened. \n \n “ Ok, here we go Pippa.

Pippa drops the gun and slowly stands up. \n \n “ Now, turn around and take off your mask. NOW! ” \n \n Pippa turns around and quickly confirms her suspicions. Her mind immediately starts racing. How, how did they get him too!? Did she make a mistake? Didn ’ t she encrypt her last message to Grant properly? \n \n ( BANG ) \n \n The sound scares Pippa out of her mind back to the present.

Men and women wore hats that covered their necks in cloth, with binoculars hanging below their chins and shovels tossed in the trunks of their cars. I sat in a front seat, windshield dusty and a dream catcher swaying dumbly as the car wobbled to a stop. We all started hopping down from our vehicles.

Wrapping up in a thermal blanket while feeling returned to my limbs, I eased into the nearest operator console. \n \n Ship status appeared to be fine, no breaches, no system failures, everything was green and yet the klaxons continued to sound. I checked our position and was surprised to see we'd made it. I pulled up the view screen and saw the small pair of specs, barely discernible, that was Centauri A and B. It had been four hundred years and we were only a month or so out from Centauri B and I'd been woken up a week earlier than I should have been. \n \n Checking the crew status I saw that the other officers' pods were rapidly reanimating as well, but I'd been awoken first. Thankfully the rest of the crew and passengers were still in deep stasis. The Genea was a colony ship and almost all of the passengers were settlers. No use waking anyone up till we solved this problem. \n \n Looking around the other ship status screens for something else that was wrong, or at least a way to silence the blaring klaxon, something impossible caught my eye. At the com officer's station an incoming transmission notification was flashing. \n \n Easing over to the communication's console I saw something more impossible, the transmission was local. I accepted the transmission, which thankfully silenced the klaxon. I was expecting something alien or fantastical, nothing else could be so far out here and able to contact the ship directly.

I introduced myself helplessly. \n `` Look just because you might not get as much time as other people on this earth does n't mean you ca n't enjoy the time you have left'' I tried to soothe the situation. `` Have you thought about doing a little trip with Iron Man? Or maybe see a different part of the world with the Flash? We can organise that in a heartbeat'' \n Tyron stared at me, with bloodshot eyes, his eyeballs seemed to retreat into their sockets, leaving big blue bags underneath them, his once athletic body seemed frail all of a sudden. \n `` I want to have the last say over my body'', he exclaimed. `` I do n't want to lie here waiting for the inevitable! Why do horrible people get more than 60 years and I will barely get 17? Why do I have to wait helplessly until my body destroys itself? If this is really supposed to be it I want to take my chances. I want to gamble my life. I want to meet the Joker and if I win he takes my life while I'm still sane and not shitting my pants and uttering nonsense, if I loose I will abide your stupid rules and wait for my end. \n But I want a chance!'' \n Stunned by this demand I was lost for words, I felt hot and cold simultaneously and my intestines cramped up even worse than before, I must have lost all colour in my face before I managed to stutter `` The Joker?!'' Now the words were flowing out of my mouth like an unstoppable stream `` that is impossible, he is not part of the program! How would we even get a hold of him? If we could how would we convince him to come here and most definitely be arrested and put behind bars for the rest of his life. With this request you are putting everyone in this hospital in danger! Apart from that killing you also is highly illegal and just out of the question'' \n `` I knew you could n't do it'' he said dauntingly with a hint of disappointment `` living your perfect life, hiding on the couch with you dogs stuffing creametarts in your happy face! Have a great life!'' \n I left the room and asked to finish my shift early, I was overwhelmed and exhausted. \n During the tram ride home I thought about Tyron's words, he hit home pretty hard but in the end he was right. I pondered over his words for hours until I made a decision. \n One that would change my life forever.\n"}

He had intended to buy a new button down, but ended up purchasing a bag of candy and a dog toy for his pup, Rufus. He tossed another gummy bear into his mouth, and chewed it slowly, trying to decide if he wanted to bother with the shirt or just go home and take a nap. \n \n A woman bustled past him, clearly in a rush, she was laden with shopping bags and when she passed Jacob one of her bags slammed into his candy-carrying arm. Gummies, M & Ms and gumballs flew all over the place. The woman did n't even stop. Jacob threw her a nasty look, and bend to recover his now ruined candies, debating weather the 5 second rule applied to floors with such heavy traffic. As he knelt, he was afforded an excellent vantage point of the lower floor of the mall, he watched the people pass and absentmindedly picked up the sugary mess. Then it happened, a man in a red tee shirt stumbled when he was near the bottom of the escalator, his pant leg was being pulled into the mechanism and it dragged him down. His head hit the edge of the escalator stairs, again and again, until someone yanked him away- by now Jacob was staring, mouth agape. The man was covered in blood, were people running around with their phones - recording the incident, calling 911, snapping pictures. \n \n Jacob decided he had seen more than enough, abandoned the candy, and made his way quickly to the exit. That night he dreamed of being eaten by an evil staircase, everything was red, and candy littered the floor. At 3am, his phone dragged him out of his nightmare \n `` H-hello?'' Jacob asked, clearing his throat \n `` Excellent work, Agent T, your target has been neutralized. Call at 0600 for your next mission.'' a woman's voice told him, then the call ended abruptly. \n Jacob lay in bed dumbfounded, his sleepy brain was trying to process what had just happened. `` Must have been a prank call..'' he thought, turning his phone on silent and settling back down to sleep. \n \n Jacob rolled out of bed at 10am, he had to be at work in an hour. Grabbing his phone he saw he had twelve missed calls- all from an unknown number, starting at 6am, three calls every hour until- \n Jacob's phone buzzed in his hand, it was an unknown number. \n `` Hello?'' \n `` Agent T, where have you been? This behavior is unacceptable, but unprecedented, so it will be our secret. Your next target has been assigned, information regarding their whereabouts, schedule and other pertinent information will be sent to you after this call.'' \n `` Who is Agent T? Is this some kind of prank?'' Jacob asked, growing more concerned by the moment. But it was too late, the mystery woman had already hung up. His phone buzzed again, Jacob stared down at it, and saw a notification from an app he has never installed `` Secure Send..'' he read the name aloud, he tapped `` read'' and waited for the screen to load. Moment later, a mugshot of a woman appeared on his screen, she looked oddly familiar but Jacob was too anxious to figure out how he knew her. Beneath the picture was the woman's information: \n > name: Brenda Marie Jones \n \n > codename: `` Sandy'' \n \n > sex: F \n \n > age: 27 \n \n > height: 5'4'' \n \n > weight: 115lbs. \n \n > hair color: blonde \n \n > eye color: brown \n \n > race: Caucasian \n \n He kept scrolling, skimming the woman's usual daily schedule, which seemed innocuous enough, a thorough list of all her relatives full names and addresses, then he saw it: \n > current location: Bean Culture, 45 Sandlake St. \n \n Jacob gasped, that was less than three blocks away from his home. \n \n > Mission: detain and await further instruction \n \n Jacob stared at his phone, hoping the mystery woman would call him back, explain to him this was one big misunderstanding. Something told him that the woman, and whomever she worked for, would n't give him a chance to explain their error and the depth of information they had on this Brenda woman was frightening enough to spur him on to Bean Culture. \n \n Jacob pushed the door open and the little bell chimed merrily, Jacob resented it's cheerfulness. Having no better ideas, he ordered a black coffee and sat down. His phone buzzed in his pocked, and he snatched it out praying that it was the mystery woman. No such luck, it was work. \n `` Jake! where are you? your shift started 10 min ago!'' his manager's voice yelled \n `` I'm uh.. I'm not feeling good.'' he said, lamely \n `` Call ahead next time, jeez.'' with that his manager hung up. Jacob was too distracted to care- he was scanning the coffee shop for Brenda. \n His eyes landed on a blond woman who was facing a wall, she was near the back typing furiously on a laptop. Jacob abandoned his coffee and approached quietly, taking the empty seat beside her. \n `` Hey'Sandy''' he said quietly, not knowing what had come over him `` I'm going to need you to come with me.'' he mimicked all the cop shows he'd ever seen \n Brenda's fingers stopped moving, her body went ridged \n `` And why is that?'' her voice betrayed a hint of fear, and Jacob was encouraged \n `` I think we both know why, Brenda.'' Jacob said, smoothly \n She had n't looked away from her screen during their entire exchange, and Jacob whispered `` Your parents, Rob and Linda Jones, live at 657 north Parr street. Your sister, Ashley Jones, lives at 87 French Boulevard, unit 6. Your aunt-'' \n `` Okay, okay.'' Brenda cut him off, and Jacob was filled with relief, he could n't remember her aunt's name or address. \n `` Quickly pack up your things, give them to me, and we will walk out of here slowly and calmly.'' Jacob instructed her, in a voice that he did n't recognize as his own. \n Brenda did as she was told, and when they were out on the street Jacob realized he had no idea where to take her. Luckily his phone buzzed in his pocket, he extracted it and tried to appear calm. \n `` Another job well done, Agent T! A car should be arriving..now.'' \n A black town car with heavily tinted windows pulled up, the left side door opened and Brenda got in and the car pulled away. Jacob stood there dumbly, still holding Brenda's things, the woman on the phone broke his reverie. \n `` Are you still there Agent T?'' \n `` Um, yeah..'' Jacob said slowly, wondering if he had just lead a woman to her death \n `` On to your next-'' \n `` Wait! I'm not Agent T. I never was, I do n't know who you are or how you got my numb-'' \n The woman cut him off with a bark of laughter \n `` You are Agent T. Check your phone after this call. I'll give you the rest of the day off.. and check your bank account.'' \n She hung up, and Jacob's phone buzzed- it was Secure Send again he tapped read and was met with this message: \n > Jacob Wethers, \n Welcome to the Industry. You have been selected based on your observed characteristics. The Industry has been watching you for a number of years and we are delighted to finally welcome you to the team. We set up the death of the man in the red shirt, and deployed `` Sandy'', your reactions and behaviors have shown us that our choice was correct. Your code name is Agent T, we encourage you to not worry about what the'T' stands for. You will be given missions via your phone each day. More information on the Industry can not be found online, and it will be a number of years before you are cleared to enter headquarters. \n All the best, \n Agent X \n \n Jacob reread the message twice, his head spinning: they had been watching him? for years? He was an agent for some company called The Industry? `` Sandy'' was n't real? \n Then he remembered what else the woman on the phone had said, and quickly pulled up his banking app. \n > Checking.. $ 500,000 \n \n > Savings... $ 500,000 \n \n He stared down at the numbers, his head was spinning. Maybe being Agent T was n't going to be so bad after all. \n \n EDIT: formatting, and to say I know this does n't quite fit the prompt, hopefully that's okay. \n\n"}

{"prompt": "I, Imrael, last of the Elohim, recite this story at the closing of days. In gladness I speak this tale, for", "human": "I, Imrael, last of the Elohim, recite this story at the closing of days. In gladness I speak this tale, for this end was not what was foretold in the prophesies; a judgement and a division, as sought by man; but a design as only the Creator could conceive; a vision held only in His unknowable heart until the last of days, when He chose to share His greatest gift. For it was always His design to thwart the folly of man with mans own strength. \n \n In a time when greed made cities of itself, and terror was both a sword and a wound to to the children of Adam, there arose out of the darkness a beast so hateful in its thoughts, and so terrible in its power that Lucifer himself would claim no kinship, and begged his Father for aid. He knew that this darkness eclipsed his own, and that it would destroy all the world, which he would rather, in his heart, corrupt. \n \n I stood by in the halls of the prophets, as the Lord sent forth his answer. I was young then, and knew not his design. Only the Christ, and the Prophet, and Abraham knew anything at all, and they did not comprehend. I remember that Abraham did not speak, only nodded his head and smiled. He stood at that time draped in splendor, unlike the others. The Christ they say, upon ascension and the receipt of the knowledge of the future, had wept, restored his crown of thorns, and would wear it evermore. The Prophet, when he joined the hosts of heaven, slung a heavy stone about his own neck, and disdained any adornment, but a simple loincloth. \n \n `` What, my brother, is this the Lord has done? ``, asked the Christ. ( I remember his blood upon his lips. ) `` I see but a girl. Can He intend another sacrifice?'' \n \n The prophet shook his weary head. His eyes were always sad. `` I think perhaps it is but one last chance for his children to see that they have broken his law, and to atone before the end.'' \n \n The girl, and God's answer, was Pela, though none of the angels knew her name, or even that she had been born. Pela's mother had tried to kill herself, and was kept alive only long enough for her to be born. Her father abandoned her at a house of prostitution, where she was first raised in a maelstrom of vice and sin. But Pela would never be touched by vice. The first woman who cared for the infant was one day forced to choose between food for Pela, or the drug that had enslaved her. She chose the pain of withdrawals, and her heart gave out, but Pela was fed. \n The woman stands now beside the Lord. Another of the women took her, but could not afford to care for her. She told the brothel owner, and he, for the first time in his life, gave in to kindness. He bade her to keep her money and care for the child until it was grown. And there she was looked after for a time, as her caretaker seemed to grow ever in kindness and wisdom. She would stare into the infant's eyes while feeding her, and the next day find another of the brothel women in some need. Through great efforts and sacrifice, the woman would tend to the needs of others whenever she could. From Pela came gentleness, and mercy, and through the woman, others would understand as well. \n But the beast was not far away. It knew that a weapon had been sent to destroy it, for its knowledge was as infinite as all the hatred held in mortal hearts. It sought her from the moment of her birth, and though it wished to visit its malice upon every soul, it was consumed with its need to defile, desecrate, and destroy this child. \n It spurred wars, instigated all manner of rape and cruelty. All in an effort to flush her from her hiding place. She was but 5 years old when it found her in a city ruled by violence, and sustained by corruption. That night it crept from room to room. It murdered the women of the brothel as it went. Their screams were the screams of lambs, innocent at last. The final victim was her protector, and the child witnessed her last, horrified breath. The beast exulted. It filled all the space around her, and whispered its most cruel taunts, as its form blotted out the light of heaven, and even the prophets could not see her beneath its shadow. \n What happened then, we could not know until now, but the beast screamed in fury as it fell to the ground, diminished, but not destroyed. Pela forgave the beast for what it had done, and set it free. \n The beast, the angels, the Prophets - none could understand; for surely this was no creature to benefit from mercy. It was beyond rage then, powerless to harm her, but unable to think of anything else. It flew from her and hid in shadowy places where men trade in misery, and live on the sufferings of others. \n \n Pela grew in an orphanage. And as she grew, she encountered many things. \n \n When another child was bullied, she spent her time making friends with both victim and tormentors until both were reconciled. \n \n When a child was returned to the orphanage, by parents who had abused her, Pela and her friends gave her a family. \n \n There was an abuser of children who worked at the orphanage who found, when he looked upon Pela, that he could no longer support such selfishness in his heart, and for the rest of his life he toiled elsewhere and sent all his earnings to the orphanage where Pela lived. \n \n Yet one day, the Beast returned. This time it had not spent its strength upon other deeds, and reserved all of its power for her destruction. The other children merely screamed in horror as it passed, for all its malevolence was forged into one purpose, and it no longer cared for the fate of others. It fell upon her in a frenzy of cold hatred. But once more, it was cast to the ground. Once more it screamed and railed. And Pela smiled sadly. The beast flew off in a flurry of black curses. \n \n The beast would come again several more times. Each time more powerful, and more furious than the last. Until, at last, on the day that I reached the age of passage, when I was to join the ranks of angels for the first time, the Archangel Gabriel said to me, with utter remorse in his voice, `` You are to protect the old woman, Pela, until the end of her days. Five others have been given this task. All have vanished from creation.'' \n I could not understand how the hosts of the Lord could be cast from creation by any but their own kin, or the Lord himself, but I did as I was bid. I walked beside Pela in her waning days. When she saw need, she gave before ever she was asked. She gave as the tree in the garden, and asked nothing. When she saw pain, she soothed it, and none could ever doubt her sincerity. She claimed no creed, and wore only those things which she made for herself, for she also cherished her own life. \n I cherished her as well. I would sweep the stones from her path, guide her through illnesses, and protect her from all possible dangers. It seemed like there were too many, but I knew she was worth all my effort. \n \n And then the Beast returned. This time it was made not from shadows, but the blackened ash of unending war. It's form blotted the sun, and it was worshiped by an army of followers, who sowed pain and devastation in its path, that it might feast upon the harvest of misery before facing its foe. This time, all the world screamed in terror at its approach. It was watched by all, as it came to her. And as I saw it before me, I knew that no mortal, no matter how gifted, could withstand such a thing. Faith withered in its presence. Hope was drowned like a spark in the depths of a cold and lifeless ocean. Its eyes could not see me, but I could see in them more malevolence than all the hosts of hell. I could not let it destroy her. Yet my own powers would not themselves be enough. As it drove upon her, I suddenly understood. I threw all of my essence into it. All of the power of creation that is vested in God's eternal servant, an immortal angel, was burst upon the Beast. I knew, then that others had come before me. They had seen her, and loved her, and for only a moment they forgot their purpose, and forsook the halls of the blessed, and spent themselves completely in her defense. I was to do the same. \n Only I was not enough. The Beast was yet strong enough to reach her. It laughed, and taunted. It surrounded her and coiled about her. But at that moment it seemed to suddenly lose its strength. It cast about in confusion as it shrank down. \n For at that moment, all the world was watching. The name of Pela was being passed from one to another and the world was talking. They shared their memories. They wept for her, and when her end was nearest, none could feel anything but grief. For but a moment, all hate, and all malice in the world was forgotten. It was then that the trumpets sounded. The seals were broken, and the horsemen came forth. They came forth at last only to water at the stream, and behold the world as one.\n"}

My parents always told me they their two luckiest days in their lives were the days my sister and I were born. \n \n Before today, I'd never considered myself lucky, I got by through highschool with no incidents while most of my friends had experienced at least two by the end of their schooling. Me? Well I experienced all seven today. \n \n It all started this morning, I was getting ready for work just like every other day for the past few years. I work in a boring IT company, everything is monotonous, but I'm getting a head of myself. Each morning I'd make my morning commute to work, it was raining and so I decided to change my routine up and instead of staying in the middle lane, I'd decided to take a left and go a different way to work. As the light turned green the my car stalled, thinking nothing of it I tried restarted it and just as I was about to turn a car ran the red light, if my car had n't have stalled I would have been hit by a speeding car. \n \n Still shaken after that encounter I made it to work, the boss wanted me to go home but I figured the monotonous of the desk job would help calm my nerves. After an hour I thought I had calmed down from the near miss. I was reaching for my water bottle, and just when I was about to take a sip, it missed completely, the bottle fell to the floor, and all of the water spilled onto the power board. My heart stopped, then kicked into overdrive. But nothing happened... \n \n I was recounting this two encounters to a women -let's call her Jenny- I work with, and had have had a crush on for the past two years since she had joined the company. She was shocked that today was the first time that I had ever been lucky and that it had been such a big experience for me. Well we got talking more and more and she jokenly said I should put on a ticket for the lottery. \n \n Thinking I was already really lucky I figured, what's there to lose, so I did it, after two years I asked her out... she said yes! Sure enough, I thought about this, or maybe over thought it. How could I have lived 25 years on this planet and never experience luck until today? And three times? This had to have been a record or something. \n \n I was sitting at my desk having my lunch when my boss came in, he had been checking up on me periodically to see if I was okay. He sat down with me and we got talking about my job and what I loved about it and where I wanted to be in five years time. After this, he mentioned that there was a position higher up that he had recommended me for and if I was willing I could start as soon as we got my replacement. I took it, better pay and less monotonous, it was just what I needed. \n \n I took her advice, I bought the lottery ticket, but I doubt I would win, I'm not that lucky. I had things to do around the house, but me and Jenny were talking all throughout the day. As I was cleaning up the house my parents grew up in -a dump which was given to me in their will- I noticed something. A floorboard was loose, I remember I had planned on fixing it up when I got around to it but I never did. And I'm glad I did n't! \n \n Underneath the floorboard was a small box, pulling it out, the dust covered everything so I knew nothing of what it could be except that it was heavy. Once I dusted everything off I realised there was no lock, no form of identification, nothing. I was curious; this box had been hidden from view for a long time... I went into the shed and got some tools, slowly I worked it around what I thought was the lid. Once I opened it I was shocked, there was a ring in there and not just any ring but a diamond ring, that was n't it though, a note accompanied the ring to. It was written by my grandfather. He was in love with someone, wanted to marry her in fact, he had the ring for her, the main reason he did n't ask was because he did n't feel like he deserved to be lucky, that she would n't have said yes, because then he'd be the luckiest guy in the world. He'd already been lucky seven times in his life, so how could she have possibly said yes? \n \n The ring and the note, I never knew him, and this gave me that little bit of insight into what he went through back then. I'm so glad I found it. I was just about to ring my baby sister and tell her what I found when she called me, I answered quickly, we both started talking at the same time.

She asked if I would wait on the phone with her while the lottery was being drawn, I was down for it so we chatted for a little while longer before it started. The numbers were getting called one by one and sure enough, they were the same numbers on my little slip of paper.... I could n't believe it, I got the first division prize. Jenny did n't believe me, who would? Even I still do n't believe it. \n \n You probably do n't believe me when I say this had all happened within twelve hours, I could n't believe my luck, I almost died, got a date with the girl of my dreams, found out I was going to be an uncle and became a multi-millionaire!\n"}

I sit in a pile of tattered cloth, once passable as clothing. Cold, wrinkled flesh has become me, like I've been left out in the rain far too long. Used. I'm sitting in an alleyway. It's dark, and there's the sun, just setting, bidding me its farewell for yet another eternity. The concrete beneath me is hard. Hard and unforgiving. I run my palms along it, struggling fruitlessly for the thousandth time to grasp something solid, to anchor me to the definitive. To something comforting. A man approaches slowly, taking long, cavalier strides towards me. Broken glass crushes into infinitesimally small pieces beneath his heels. \n \n \n I am scared. I can feel light precipitation coming down, striking me, cold and sharp and stinging, like small icy spears dropped from the skies. The rain can hardly, however, be distinguished from the perspiration which coats my body. I'm shaking. I have to stop shaking. \n \n \n The man comes closer, and I can see the lust, the rage, the sin in his eyes. All that is wrong in him will perhaps disappear from him for a few fleeting moments. He feels like death can not catch him or even find him in these moments. I know this because I've seen him so many times. \n \n \n Fuck him. Nevermore. \n \n \n I gaze up to the sky, and see a similar sight: hanging from beneath the moon, a couple words, `` Rape Me.'' I grasp for anything with my bloodied hands, unable to gain any stability. He comes onto me, grasping my throat with a course, calloused hand. I ready my left leg, and kick with all my force, into his groin. A grunt. Blood splatters onto my face, some going to my eyes, making me blink. Fuck him. \n \n \n He rolls over, clutching himself. I rise from the ground. I kick him in the ribs, the face, the groin. I stomp his chest. He wheezes. His eyes close shut, swollen and blue. I turn and walk from the pathetic animal. I feel the warmth of the sun as it rises, rays of light stretching through the alleyway to touch my back. I turn to see the sun, beneath which hangs a strange word, the meaning of which I'm not familiar with: `` Tubthumping.'' \n \n \n I remove a phone from the pocket of my now mended jeans. The phone displays a playlist of 1001 songs. At the bottom is `` Tubthumping.'' I scroll up, up, up. Whoever made this playlist must like Nirvana.\n"}

Sure it's creepy at the start and gets annoying after awhile but once you get used to it. It is actually really amusing and entertaining to watch as it tries to get to you. All those constant back and forth arguments and debate we had it was really entertaining and put lots of perspective into my life. Even made me better at my job. Oh well no point in looking back, it's gone now. \n ________________________________________________________________ \n \n As I was dozing off to the sound of the subway I felt a sudden tug on my jacket. I spun around to see a man in a complete mess, his eyes were bloodshot and had snot running down his nose. He was trying to say something. \n \n'T-take it, please take it back, please, please please...' \n \n After finishing his sentence he collapse into a kneeling position and kept begging me to take it off his hands. I did n't recognise it at first, but upon closer inspection I realise it was my Behelit, at least that's what it calls itself. The Behelit it resembles an egg with a set of human facial features scattered randomly across its surface, giving the item a rather disconcerting appearance. It's the first time I saw the Behelit so bright red, so healthy looking. It's lucky that this was the last train back. My compartment was completely empty except for me and the man. \n \n I was so entrance by the Behelit's new look that I almost forgot about the man begging me to take it back. I could n't help but laugh at his misery. \n \n'Well, well looks like we have a thieving rat here. I'm curious how much do you think this particular item is worth?' \n \n'I'm sorry, please I know I fucked up. Please make it leave.' \n \n'Not too fond of nether realms eh I suppose. Tell me, what offers did it make? I'm Sam nice to meet you, and you are?' \n \n The train came to an abrupt stop, breaking every physics law there is while me and the man sat exactly where we are. It's almost if there is no such thing as inertia.'Damn, it got powerful' I thought to myself. The man started to freak out as the lights in the compartment grew dimmer and dimmer. The sound of the PA system announcing service would continue shortly telling us to stay calm was distorted and demonic sounding. The man was losing his marbles scrambling under the seat as if to take cover from earthquake. \n \n I got annoyed at this scene. I got annoyed I had to squat down to look at this mother fucker. I got annoyed that this mother fucker was making all sort of unruly noises. \n \n'What the fuck is wrong with you? Why in the fuckity fuck are you hiding under there? And I asked you a question, *thief*.' As I pull him closer to me. \n \n'What's your fucking name?' I pulled the man out from under the seat. \n \n The man was out of breath as he was trying to say his name, shock, no doubt. He feels light, no more than 60 kilos definitely malnutritioned for his height. Wo n't last 5 seconds against me, *if* he tries anything. \n \n J:'Jo-Joey' \n \n S:'Hi Joey the thieving faggot' I gave him a quick Jab to his ribs.'That's for stealing my shit' I quickly snatch the Behelit out from his hand before Joey collapsed on to the floor. \n \n S:'Stop being a little whimp, I did n't hit you that hard and I would like you to concentrate for the next few minutes. Do you think you'd be able to manage that?' \n \n J:'Whaa... is it gone? Will it leave me alone now?' \n \n I got annoyed at him answering my question with another question. I let out a long sigh. Forgetting about the creepy surrounding that we are in. A few hundred meters underground stuck in a train compartment with a demonic energy swirling around us. I should probably cut Joey some slack. \n \n S:'Joey, I ca n't answer what you just asked me because I am not an expert in this. But I do know that once you stole this egg from me that the vision or what ever the fuck this is stopped happening. So maybe it'll leave you alone.' \n \n Joey started to look relieve, still annoyed at how Joey looked. All snot and tears mumbling away. \n \n S:'Now Joey. I asked you a few questions and so far you have n't gave me the answers I'm looking for. I WOULD LIKE TO NOT LOSE MY SHIT AND BASH THE EVER LOVING FUCK OUT OF YOU. So Joey? What offers did this egg made you?' \n \n J:'-I-I I am sorry, he told me it would make me the best thieve the world has ever seen and I can do all the drugs and women I can ever dream of and take away all my illness and problems. Iiii-It wants me to kill my mom and my friends. Says it's like a down payment or something. It says it'll teach me how to do it' \n \n S:'I presumed you did n't take the offer.' \n \n J:'Fuck no, this thing its evil and I am not gon na kill my friends for some demon' \n \n S:'Huh, a thief with a heart, and what do you do for a living?' \n \n J:'I'm-m a thief, I steal things and get it to a buyer. People sometimes have request, and I deliver the best I can.' \n \n S:'Someone told you to steal this thing from me?' \n \n J:'No-no, I do n't know why I did that. I never did things this carelessly. It just felt impulsive to do what I did.' \n \n S:'So you being a thieve and whatnot you would know contacts to purchase guns. Safe places to hide and all those shady shit.' \n \n J:'Ye-yeah... I guess. Why would you need to know?' \n \n S:'Let me get back to you shortly' \n \n S:'And as for you, you fuck head' Referring to the Behelit. \n \n I stood up and stare directly into my own reflection in the window. \n \n S:'FUCKING get this train moving I've got places TO BE.' \n \n In that short instance the subway jumped to life and everything went back to normal. Joey looking as confused as ever and just sort of stared at me waiting for me to continue where I left off. \n \n S:'See Joey, the way I see it you owe me twice. Once because you stole some shit from me, second I help you exorcised this whatever you call it.' \n \n J:'So its done? It's gone? It'll leave me alone?' \n \n S:'In a manner of speaking, yes. See, when the first time I got this egg-head I tried getting rid of it. Does n't matter what I do, toss it, burn it, smash it. Always, always comes back. Funny thing, once you stole it from me it stopped reappearing. So from what I gather, you ca n't get rid of it by giving it away. You get rid of it when someone willingly takes it from you. It's a theory I just came up with.' \n \n J:'S-Sure anything for you, whadya need? From the looks you look pretty well off, heh' \n \n S:'I do n't need *things* from Joey, oh no. Joey, from this day on you work for me.' \n \n J:'Work for you? I'm a thieve that's all I know. I steal things and I get things to people. That's all I know.' \n \n S:'Oh do n't be coy with me Joey, you tracked me down. I have been traveling from one place to the other non-stop since forever. Even the cops could n't find me. But you did, you picked my pocket and now here you are thousands of kilometer away from where we first met.' \n \n \n S:'You Joey, you are n't a normal thief. You are an international thief. Like those guys in Oceans Eleven. You can organise stuff and you are resourceful. I need people like you and you owe me.' \n \n J:'What do you even want me to do? What do you even do?' \n \n S:'I hunt things Joey, oh hohohoho. I hunt things.'\n"}

Especially a child playing a stupid prank. I could n't really stay mad though. Cute little cream puff, with her red hair done up in short pig tails, or whatever you call them. The big green eyes kinda reminded me of the old pictures from when Sis was her age. \n \n `` Look kid, for reasons your parents will explain in the near future, I categorically can not be your father. The last few years have kept me... busy.'' The child looked like she might be more embarrassed than anything else. No wonder considering what a poor trick this was. Like I was going to get buried in my work and forget my first time or something. `` Ca n't see anyone out there. Hmmm...'' \n \n *sigh* `` Okay, do you need help finding your folks or something? Are you lost or what?'' The sooner I dealt with this the faster I could get back to the prototype. \n \n The girl took a big breath. \n \n `` Promise you wo n't be mad?'' Mad about being interrupted while working on the greatest theory and invention of the modern age? For a damn joke? Nonsense. \n \n `` Yeah, Cream Puff, tell the truth and I wo n't be short-tempered with you.'' That got a weird little giggle out of her. \n \n `` What? You like that nickname?'' Despite my mood and exhaustion I cracked a bit of a smile. \n \n `` Okay... remember no being mad... I may have played in your workshop-'' \n \n `` Kid, lem me stop you right there. I have been in or near my workshop constantly for two days and only briefly left it at all over the past week. No one but me has been in there for some time.'' \n \n `` Noooo.'' She looked at me like I was making her life harder on purpose. `` Not this workshop. The big one. At hoooome.'' \n \n `` I... Little girl this is my home!'' \n \n `` You promised you would n't get mad! I just wanted to play in the- the uh.'' She started fishing around in a pocket and pulled out a scrap of paper. `` Thuuuuh Dy... max... ian- Thats it! The dymaxian chronolologerzer!'' \n \n I slumped against the wall. No one should know about that. Maybe a thief could get in and steal the prototype, the blueprints, or the research and theories. But I never even wrote down the name of the damn thing. Never even spoke it out loud! \n \n `` Give me that paper!''... Good God, that was my handwriting. My higher brain went into overdrive while what was left went on autopilot. Weird what you notice or hang onto when you might have gone insane. `` The correct pronunciation, Cream Puff, is chronologizer. Dymaxian Chronologizer.'' \n \n Everything came crashing to a halt. `` Wait. You're saying that you, little girl, are my daughter from the future?'' \n \n `` Yes! That's what I tried to tell you. And you promised you would n't be mad.'' \n \n `` Now that I really look at you... I see a pretty strong resemblance to your aunt when she was your age.'' \n \n `` Aunt Sally!'' Aunt sally, eh? Strange. \n \n `` Kid, where is the dymaxian? You came here somehow so we should be able to send you home!'' \n \n `` Uhh... promise not to be mad...'' \n \n `` Shit.' \n \n `` Bad word!'' \n \n A moment later I was looking at the molten remains of a time machine engine slowly fusing into my cement drive way. \n \n `` I see. Still some bugs in the system. Alright kid- Look. what do I call you?'' \n \n `` Cream Puff'', she said smiling up at my while leaning on my leg. \n \n `` No, I meant what is your name.'' \n \n `` Guenevere.'' \n \n `` Merciful Father above. Really? I named you Gwen?'' \n \n `` Mommy picked it out.'' I noted a tone of reproach in her voice. If I were to guess'Mommy' and I had discussed this. Or will at some point. Apparently I lost. \n \n \n `` So, do you know your mother's name?'' I turned her around and walked her into the house. \n \n `` Yeah. It's Anya'' \n \n `` Oh? The only Anya I know right now is the one across the street.'' \n \n `` That's Mommy! Can we go see her?!'' \n \n `` What? Woah, nononono! Anya is like, just barely in high school. She ca n't be your Mom. \n \n `` Aunt Sally called you a... a...'' \n \n ``... cradle robber?'' \n \n `` Uh-huh! and a pedo!'' I set her in a chair facing the tv and passed her a bottle of water. `` Yeah, that sounds like Sally. Remind me to give her a dymaxian so she can see the dinosaurs. \n \n `` I suppose we need to figure out what to do until I can send you forwards to you own time again. We got ta make sure not to put you in a time during which you already exist. The numbers and equations do not paint a pretty picture of that mistake. For now just relax. I'll take care of everything.'' \n \n Eventually I explained my research on time travel to Sally and my folks. Then they met Gwen. Sally fainted. As for my parents, well, the joy of a grandchild outweighs any concerns about the fabric of space-time or questions on the nature of causality. It was, however, a little odd introducing my wife-to-be to'cousin Gwen' four years before I asked her out. \n \n \n \n `` Got your things all packed?'' \n \n `` Yeah, Dad. And I picked up your tux on the way home.'' \n \n `` Thanks, Gwen. Is my car still intact?'' \n \n `` Uncalled for.'' \n \n We both heard some muffled swearing from the back of the house and simultaneously shouted, `` Bad Words, Bad Words!'' \n \n `` I'm not putting anymore money in your swear jar, Guenevere. Now please help me with this accursed wedding dress.'' \n \n `` Sure, Mom.'' \n \n After the wedding we went back to my workshop and fired up my first dymaxian chronologizer prototype. \n \n `` You should wind up in the field behind the house. It will be eighteen hours after your ten year old self steps into the dymaxian that brought you here. You ready?'' \n \n `` I think so. I'll see you guys in a few minutes I guess. Seeing as I'm taking the quick way.'' She smiled at us. The same smile as when she first showed up on my front porch. \n \n `` We'll see you in nine months, Cream Puff.'' \n \n `` Gross, Dad.''\n"}

Abe was tired of the long lines of inventors with applications for new patents, all to be filed and sealed for approval at a later date. The droll of this daily life was only rarely broken up by the occasional invention that really interested Abe. On this particular day though, while Abe was going finishing the paperwork on a patent for a curious man named John Ruggles, who had the absurd idea to put tires on locomotives, a loud argument broke out between three oddly dressed men near the middle of the line. It seemed to be the case that all three had the same invention and were rushing to patent it first. \n \n Abe was intrigued. He quickly went over to the three men to stop a fight from occurring and to find out what kind of invention could cause three men to argue so vehemently. When Abe finally calmed the men down and asked them what the matter was, one man stepped forward and began to explain, \n \n `` I invented a time traveling machine that can take the user forward to see the future. It really is amazing, and I need to patent it in order to make my design profitable.'' At this the other two men began to tell the first that they had invented it first, but Abe just held up his hand to stop them. \n \n Abe was deeply annoyed and thought to himself, `` Perhaps today will be just another day after all. How dull.'' He walked over to his desk, pulled out a worn notebook, and came back to the three and began to read, `` Prior Art Related to Time Travel: Mahabharata, Talmud, De Nugis Curialium, Anno 7603, and according to another oddly dressed chap who came in last week, some man named Wells will publish a book called The Time Machine in sixty years. I'm sorry, but your idea has been done. Maybe next time you'll try to patent something that is an actually novel idea.\n"}

He did n't know who to call, or what to do. He could n't believe what he just saw, and yet, it was all happening, all so very real in front of his eyes. Jordan Miller was always a simple man. For 20 years, Jordan walked into his lab at 9am, hair combed and a medium black coffee in his hand, and left at 6pm to meet his loving wife, Natalie, and his one kid he was proud to have. He was happy that God blessed him with such a loving family, but somehow, it was n't enough. As the energy of the implosion approached the ISS, Jordan remembered the one thing that brought him here, that brought him away from Earth, away from his family. `` Looking for 3 candidates to go aboard the ISS for minor repairs, contract period 4 months. Training to be provided, heavy background in physics recommended.'' Jordan stared long and hard at the advertisement he saw in his morning paper, not sure what to make of it. He felt something, something he had n't felt in what seemed to be decades. A sudden rush, a sense of warmth, a feeling of belonging. This was it, this is what felt right. Jordan always pondered as to why the ISS would put out such an advertisement in a newspaper, but calling it'faith' seemed to do enough justice in Jordan's mind. Not much time now, things are starting to get hot. Jordan looks around the ISS, looks for something, looks for anything that would help him. His mind is drawing blanks. `` Think, think - What is the next step?'' Jordan thought to himself. The intensive and rigorous training he went through did not prepare for anything as close to a situation as this. A sheering pain then went through his body. Jordan was n't sure what it was, but he was sure it was n't from the after-math of the implosion. He had felt this pain before, and he knew many before had felt the same too. He then knew what it was, and as much as he tried to remind himself that it should n't be this painful, he could n't do anything to block the emotion that was causing him this pain, regret. He heard her voice resonate in his head, and for a brief moment wished with all his might that she could be right next to him. `` It's only 4 months, honey. I'll be back before you know it. I'll be a hero. It'll be like nothing else.'' Jordan told a shaken Natalie, tears rolling down her cheeks. `` But what if you do n't come back?''\n"}

Today, that would all change. \n \n I waltzed into my high school classroom. It was bare; I had only gotten the job about a week before school started. No time at all to decorate. That would make it all the better, y'see. Students would filter in to their American History class, bored, angsty, hopeless... pencil-less. They'd expect nothing short of, well, *nothing* from their new teacher. And then... And *then... * \n \n Oh, it made me giddy just to think about it. \n \n I slung my backpack onto the floor next to my chair and took a heavy seat. The cushion let loose a satisfying *pppssssss* as I hunkered down. \n \n Any minute now. Any minute. \n \n The first student, timid and short, crept in through the door. Obviously going to be the quiet smarty. He definitely would n't need my amazing, supernatural help. \n \n Next came a gaggle of preps, talking and laughing and gossiping loudly. They shot a glance at the quiet kid and giggled. Eventually, a steady stream of students was flowing in. God, there had to be at least forty kids in this class. One of them was *bound* to need my help. \n \n The late bell rang just as the last straggler stumbled in out of breath. I sat at my desk, hands clasped together calmly. This is it. This is the moment. \n \n `` So, class,'' I said, and the scattered whispers quieted immediately. `` This is American History. I would like you to pull out a sheet of paper and a pencil for notes. We will be diving right in.'' \n \n The loud shuffling of paper overtook the room for a few moments. The overhead projector warmed to life slowly as I pulled the notes up on my laptop. A few giggles sounded from the gossip girls, and I ignored them. \n \n `` I know you guys,'' I said slyly, trying to keep the excitement out of my voice. `` One of you probably forgot your pencil. Or a bunch of you. Does anybody in here need a spare pencil?'' \n \n A wobbly hand slowly made its way up into the air. It was the quiet kid. Huh, of all people, I thought he'd be prepared. \n \n I smiled. `` Then,'' I said, holding my hand out towards the mass of students, `` I'll make one for you.'' \n \n A pencil materialized in my outstretched hand, new and perfectly sharpened. An audible gasp rippled through the class. \n \n The quiet kid slowly, *slowly* stood up from his seat and walked to the front. His hand hovered over mine, unsure whether or not to take the pencil. He glanced up at me. \n \n `` Oh.'' I looked at the pencil in my hand pointedly. `` You would like two, would n't you? Never hurts to be prepared.'' \n \n The class gasped again then began shouting in confused excitement. Another pencil had constructed itself from the aether. It lay in my hand right next to the first. It was perfect. Beautiful. *Useful. * My superpower was *useful. * \n \n `` Th-Thanks,'' he muttered, his eyes glued to the magical writing utensils. He plucked them out of my hand and walked back to his seat. The entire class followed the pencils seated in his upturned hand with their eyes. \n \n Hell. Yes. \n \n Pencil Man was going to make a name for himself.\n"}

The darkness of the closet mixed with the faint smell of warm clothes and moth balls had done a number on my mind. My heart began racing as I watched my childhood teddy-bear peek from behind the closet door into the room before quickly and quietly shutting it again when a shadow crossed the wall before us. Was I hallucinating? Surely, I must have been. \n \n Goku reached out a plastic arm and patted me mechanically on my knee, as though to comfort me. I definitely felt that. I was n't dreaming. \n \n `` Okay, I think they've left.'' Teddy said, turning back toward me and the other toys. He rubbed his stubby arms together a moment before looking directly toward me. \n \n `` So, Tad - I guess you're wondering why we kidnapped you from work and brought you here today.'' \n \n `` Yeah.'' I uttered, `` You could say that.'' \n \n `` We need you.'' Teddy said softly. He seemed to say everything softly. \n \n `` For what, exactly?'' I managed. \n \n `` For them.'' came the growls of a battered red Bionicle whose arm pointed firmly at the closet door. \n \n `` Yes,'' urged Teddy, `` You're the only one who can help us now.'' \n \n `` I do n't understand!'' I said, more loudly now. \n \n `` Shhh, please!'' Teddy cooed, tapping my foot with an arm and looking desperately at the door behind himself, `` Please keep it down!'' \n \n `` Who are *they*? Why are you alive? Am I going insane?'' I whispered frantically, clutching the carpet either side of me as though to keep myself from falling off the world. \n \n The Gundam figurine muttered something in what sounded like Japanese, but I could n't understand it. I simply shook my head. \n \n `` He said you are n't going insane. We've been brought to life by the same thing that brought *them* to life.'' Darth Maul said, seeing my vacant expression. \n \n `` Which is?'' \n \n `` We do n't know.'' Teddy said, `` Which is why we need your help.'' \n \n `` Who are *they*, then?

James stared intently at the computer monitor. It was on, but the Internet - the gateway to porn and silly memes - was OFF. Someone had turned off his Internet. Probably his meddling daughter, a different approach to her usual `` computer intervention.'' \n \n `` You game way too much, Dad! When are you going back to work?'' she would say ( frequently ) at the breakfast table, when Daddy still got up at that hour. \n \n `` Jessica! What happened to the Internet? I ca n't get on the Internet!'' \n \n James had some serious Internet business to attend to in the next five minutes, and his daughter's incessant decrying of his hobby was beginning to grate on his nerves, specifically the lengths at which she was willing to go to stop him from participating in it. Like **turning off the Internet! ** \n \n `` JESSICA! THE INTERNET - WHY WO N'T IT GO TO GOOGLE!'' \n \n He was panicked, his heartbeat so intense it felt as though it could rupture his chest cavity with a single thwump. He had become a creature of habit in his twilight years of beautiful, beautiful long-term disability, and any interruption of his usual routine could set him off. \n \n *Still no response from Jess. * `` JESS! JESSICA! PLUG THE INTERNET BACK IN! DO THE ON-OFF THING!'' \n \n James turned, looking out the window, checking for a car: None. \n \n That's right - she was away, out of state, for school. Had been for a few months. James' late-night scotches had increased in frequency and potency in the previous six months. To some, they'd become a problem. \n \n In a moment of desperation, James pulled a Blackberry from his pocket. Relief washed over him like a calming wave. Fetish porn and no-rules chat rooms, available at the click of a button! Fantasy football? That's his Tuesday *and* Thursday! Big schedule this week! \n \n James began to navigate the outdated Blackberry's warped version of the Internet, a place from which few return ( at least with any worthwhile information or productive deed completed ), and soon found it to be completely useless. \n \n `` Fuck it - I'm going to Starbucks.'' \n\n"}

No electricity, no Internet", "human": "Steve was bored. \n \n Steve was usually bored nowadays. It was hard to find things to do after the apocalypse had happened. No electricity, no Internet, the battery on his smartphone ran out years ago! He used to spend hours playing that one game about matching and exploding things! \n \n He had things to read, bookstores were n't prime targets once the looting began, but he was never a'reader'. He filled up bookcase or two at his home over the last few years, though, just in case he ever had any ( living ) guests come by. He did n't want people to think he was n't smart! \n \n But he never had any guests... he wondered if anyone else was alive out there like him. Whatever had turned so many people into the living dead seemed to have a different effect on him. When other people died, usually from an infected bite, they came back as a zombie. Steve, on the other hand, just came back as himself after he died. Dying was never a fun experience for Steve, so he tried to avoid it when he could. Steve often wondered if he was'alive' in the strictest sense though. He was never hungry, or thirsty, but his body did n't deteriorate like he assumed it should from not eating and drinking anything for a few years. He never went to the bathroom, which he frankly did n't miss. He *felt* alive, and could talk and function as if he was alive, so even though things pointed to the contrary, he was pretty sure he WAS alive! \n \n The zombies did n't think so, though. They seemed to ignore him whenever he was out and about, and left his house alone too. He could get a response from them sometimes, like his old friend Frank who usually aimlessly wanders downtown. Steve was sure he waved back at him once when he said'Hey Frank!', albeit a very strange and jagged wave. He talked with other zombies to combat boredom and overall loneliness, but they were n't great conversationalists... \n \n One thing he wished he could do was play board games with the zombies. He loved board games and have tons of them. Every once in awhile he would setup a game somewhere in the park, covered in grass dead with overgrown weeds, grab a zombie or two and sit them down to try to teach them how to play. It was hard to keep their attention, and even then they did n't really listen to his instructions very well... He usually stuck with easier games like checkers and Sorry!, and managed to finish a few games now and again. One time he played Chess with an older looking zombie and lost in two turns. He still did n't know how that happened... he was n't very good at Chess. \n \n He had n't seen another living person in ages. That all changed one day when he was out for his morning walk in the early morning when he saw an unfamiliar car parked outside the Sav-N-Mart. A couple of people were loading some stuff into the car, a man and a woman, scavenging supplies probably. \n \n He got exited. Very excited! He could n't hold back his excitement as he started to sprint at full speed towards the car. \n \n `` Hey!'' he yelled, waving at them as he ran, `` Heeey!'' \n \n The woman dropped a cardboard box she was carrying, quickly leveling a pistol with lightning speed at Steve. He was about to say'Wait!' before he was shot in the chest. Steve tumbled forward in pain, skidding a bit on the asphalt of the parking lot, coming to a stop a few feet away from the couple of scavengers. \n \n `` Jesus...'' the man asked, putting away the box in the car quickly, `` They can run now?'' \n \n `` And yell too...'' the woman said, about to holster her gun when she saw Steve move a bit on the ground. \n \n `` You missed his head.'' the man said with a chuckle, `` I thought you were getting good at this?'' \n \n `` Shut up!'' she replied and heard Steve moan a bit, ``... aw shit... he might've been a survivor...'' \n \n `` Shit...'' the man said, shaking his head, `` I doubt we can do anything for him. Put a bullet where you missed the first time so he does n't become one of them.'' \n \n She sighed and walked over to Steve. He rolled over with a groan and looked up the woman who was pointing her gun at him. He raised her hands. `` Wait wait!'' \n \n She hesitated a bit, still aiming the gun at his head. `` Sorry... about shooting you. But we do n't have the medical supplies to take care of those gunshot wounds. Best we can do is put a bullet in your brain to stop you from becoming one of them...'' \n \n `` Wait! No!'' Steve said, starting to get up, `` Its fine, really!'' He stood up infront of her, opening his arms to show he was doing fine. There were holes in his shirt, but no blood. \n \n She did n't know what to think, still aiming her gun at him. Was he wearing a bullet proof vest? No... she could see what looked like human scar tissue through the holes in his shirt. She took a step back and kept her gun aimed at him, pointing at his head this time. `` What... what the hell are you?!'' \n \n `` Uh, Cherry?'' The man said from the car seated in the drivers seat, the engine idling. The collective groans of zombies were growing in the distance, `` We got some friends incoming!'' \n \n `` Shit!'' Cherry said, looking at the car and then back at Steve. `` Your coming with us! I need to know what the *hell* you are!'' \n \n `` Sounds good to me!'' Steve said with a smile, following Cherry as he lead him to the car, keeping the gun pointed at him as if he was a hostage. When she realized that Steve did n't need coercion to join them, and did n't even seem concerned at all by a gun pointed to his head, she holstered her gun and quickly got into the front seat. \n \n Steve got in the backseat which was practical packed with supplies the couple must have gathered: food, water, gas, tool, and some other random items. He had to wedge himself in there to fit. The man already accelerated the car and took out of the parking lot before he even got seated. \n \n `` We can stop at my place! Its a pretty quiet neighborhood nowadays and not far from here.'' Steve said to them, trying to put on a seatbelt ( always wear your seatbelt! ), `` Do you guys like board games?'' \n \n\n"}

I was in my living room, browsing people's artistic creations on my 55'' HDTV, when my screen became an infintitely long hallway, much like when you face two mirrors towards each other. From within came the sound of elephants, clashing of swords, and all manner of rainforest wildlife. \n \n I wisely jumped out of the way before they came out, destroying half my house. \n \n The most logical thing to do was alert my friends to this bloody awesome scene, and then call the insurance company and police. However, the network was being swamped; everyone else was thinking the same thing, as it was happening in their living rooms as well! \n \n Reports started coming in: people dressed in strange costumes, talking strange languages. There were mutated creatures and high-energy explosions throughout the globe, which were thankfully confined to sparsely-populated desert and mountainous regions. \n \n No one really put two and two together until they saw a wizard, with a lightning bolt for a scar, casting a thunderbolt in Trafalgar square. Or until a battallion of pointy-eared fair folk were found in a national park, speaking a foreign yet vaguely familiar language. \n \n Either there was a global convention, or the world of fiction merged with ours. \n \n The Breach has no physical form. There was no crater formed on impact, nor a collision trajectory viewable from space. Rather than coming from the outside, it seemed to have come from the inside, through the mediums we used to craft those worlds: books, pens, tablets, and even paintings were gates and keys. \n \n Half the world did n't know what to do. \n \n The other half, we of the younger generations, knew exactly what to do. \n \n Every creative writer and artist became an architect. With their tools at hand, they could summon forth fantastic creatures, and rearrange a piece of the world to their own image. Art and words became their spell circles and incantations. Brush and pen became their wands. \n \n We discovered that how big a person's alterations could be was strongly dependent on their level of delusion and artistic ability. The more practical you were, the less power you had in this New World. Naturally, anyone who's won the lottery, received an inheritance, or suddenly found themselves attractive can tell you what this'll do to a person. \n \n War broke out. First it was between the Realists and the Dreamers, as they called themselves. The Realists quickly lost ground, and now live on reservations. Then there were fights between the Dreamers, divided by canon. OCs became mercenaries, their'delusion field' only extending to a small radius around their person. Those who subscribed to particular canons could form gestalts, and entire cities could congregate together to essentially change the laws, within a six mile radius, to suit the consensus. \n \n But though laws of physics can be changed, there is still a meta to metaphysics. The newest academic field is Fandom Physics, which analyses the large-scale phenomena that result when different canons collide. What happens if two cities have six-mile Delusion Fields, but are only three miles apart? Will they cleanly integrate like most Modern stories do? Or collide violently when you cross Final Fantasy and Dead or Alive ( Monty Oum has been elevated to patron deity of that region ). \n \n And magic! Vancian and Functional magic paradigms have mutually exclusive clauses. What does the hybrid look like? \n \n This is truly an exciting time we live in. I hope I live long enough to record it!\n"}

There were a lot of things going on when it happened and she moved so quickly it was hard to tell if she even hesitated to weigh all the options. \n \n Well, I guess there really were n't any options. Her or me. Rational logic dictates self above all else, so I suppose there's really no faulting her. \n \n We'd come to this country to help, too. Humanitarian goals. That seems funny now as I bounce around in the back of a van with a black bag over my head. We'd been approached by the company to go and disrupt human trafficking elements around the mountains. Apparently it was such a massive source of revenue for the bad guys that operations were finally being conducted to curtail it. \n \n She spoke so fluently too, of course she was going to get selected for the op. I was just here because I'm a good shot and handy with an aid bag. We came in under the guise of a medical mission. It took months to finally track all the routes and shore up all of the potential contacts into reliable marks. All that effort, even a few dozen girls and boys freed, some even returned to their parents. \n \n This last meeting was supposed to be *the last meeting*. We were heading to link up with one of the guides that led the vans carrying human cargo into the darkness and the ether of whatever awful place those folks end up. It had all sounded fishy from the start. What war lord was going to just let outsiders medically inspect his cargo when he could just as easily sell the sick kids to a creepy customer as double the price. \n \n When those first guys pulled their rifles up from under their coats I was swearing under my breath that I'd hidden my pistol so far around my back. But then she just threw me under the bus like that. Pushed me forward and told them I was a traitor, sold me out in a second. \n \n On the plus side, I think they let her go, so there's always the chance she could get help to me in time. But so many people vanish in these mountains in so many awful ways... \n \n She was better suited to finish the mission anyways. I hope I'm a life spent and not wasted.\n"}

Screams the captain, seemingly to the air. You've learned not to question it. The enemy fort stands before you and your comrades. Hundreds of Reichsmen stand by your side. This mere rebel outpost should be no match for the endless strength of the Holy Roman Empire. \n \n But you know better. The Francs, the Poles, the Danes. Each have made a mockery of your homeland's imperial might by running rings around every army that the Kaiser sends forth. You have served in enough battles to know that the rulers of the empire are all, without question, madmen. \n \n This is exemplified perfectly by the four battering rams laid in front of your forces, crewed by all of the armies archers. Without the cover of those archers, countless men will die before this meager stronghold. You have seen it all before. You wish only for it to stop. \n \n The war horn sounds and the attack begins. All four battering rams roll forward and your infantry units follow. You notice some of the armies mercenaries charging towards the gates. They move ahead of the rams and arrows rain down upon them. By the time they reach the gate, most are dead. \n \n You see the archers behind the rams fall victim next. A few moments later and your men are under attack. Hundreds fall in the next few minutes. The man to your left erupts in flames. You ignore the screaming. One of the rams lies still, abandoned by its crew. \n \n You trudge through a hellscape of broken, trampled bodies. But you march on. The captain falls to a stray arrow. You march on. One of the ram catches fire. You march on. \n \n With each blow the ram comes closer to breaking the gate. A few tired and worn archers heave the timber log against a rickety wooden barricade. The other ram is propped awkwardly against the wall, as if it was intended to breach the walls themselves. Its crew are all long dead. Perhaps one in three still live out of a thousand. This may be the end. The thought is n't unwelcome \n \n Suddenly the gate crashes in. A beleaguered cheer goes up from the army. You rush forward, across the piles of your dead brothers and into the fort. Your sword is raised in anticipation. Your shield arm is ready for any foe. \n \n Farmers. maybe two hundred farmers with bows and pikes. You slaughter those that stand in your way. The survivors break and run for the centre of their stronghold. you get ready to give chase when something slams you to the ground. You look up in time to watch the captain's cavalry race ahead of the army and into the reformed ranks of the enemy. \n \n As the rest of the army hurries to follow, the horsemen are hacked to pieces. What follows ca n't be called combat. You and your men lazily walk up to the enemy in small clumps and swing wildly at the enemy until they are all dead. \n \n The day has been won. There are no cheers as the soldiers loot valuables from the fallen. No songs are sung as you bury your friends. A few tattered flags hang over a strategically insignificant battlefield. You doubt the surrounding farmland will even bring in any revenue for the empire. \n \n You wash the blood from your armour and then from your skin. You prepare to find somewhere to sleep when a rider carrying the Kaiser's personal colours arrives into the fort. He seeks you out and declares that you are now the leader of this army. He then hands you a scroll. You read its contents quietly. \n \n Another army, the Milanese. A few weeks south of your location. You are tasked with engaging what seems to be a vastly superior fighting force. The orders demand that you take all of your soldiers with you. So the Fort will fall into rebel hands, again. You spit on the ground in disgust and send a warrior away to inform the men. \n \n The rider sits there patiently and awaits your response. Just like every man before you who was drafted to command, you feel the weight of responsibility crush all hope from you. A single tear runs down your face and you stare back at the rider. There's only one thing you can possibly say. \n \n `` JA VE VIL CWUSH DiM KAISER!''\n"}

Many would argue that it was'quite improper' for a young lady of her age to be studying such foul, loathsome creatures. Others tried to discredit her reputation, claiming that werewolves were `` dangerous beasts, the darkest of the lot, and not to be trifled with''. \n \n Then she remembered thinking that those tossers could `` go stuff themselves'', for all she cared. She'd always been a clever girl, always earning top marks across her classes, and keeping her chin up when some of her less desirable male classmates sneered at her. Her mind whirred a mile a minute, always thinking of the possibilities, and, without fail, she would devour as many tomes as she could get her hands on. \n \n Those included books on werewolves, and, in particular, learning how to transform one's physical form into the shape of an animal. \n \n When she had just started learning about such magic, she had an unfortunate mishap with her first'experiment'. While she had largely retained her human form, she had sprouted a coat of black fur, whiskers, pointed ears, and even a *tail*. However, the transformation had been only halfway - utterly incomplete - but, thanks to a stay in the hospital, she was right as rain in time. It had taken a few weeks of being forced to drink disgusting concoctions, along with the nurses giving her little to no privacy, but she was quite fortunate to make it out unscathed. \n \n When they had discharged her, they warned her not to attempt such `` foolhardiness'' again. \n \n After all, werewolves were seen as subhuman beings. They were largely confined to the dregs of society - the poorest of the poor - and many were homeless. Others lived in haphazard `` shantytowns'' in various woods across the nation, seeking to distance themselves from the hateful gaze of the uninfected. Similar could be said of their skinwalker'cousins' - those that could transform into animals at will, and back - but these were-variants were far more accepted. Unlike lycanthropes, they could control the change at will. \n \n However, skinwalkers were far more rare than werewolves. Due to the stigma against were-variants in general, only a handful attempted to learn how to transform, and fewer still succeeded. \n \n Early on, she had determined to become one of those who did. \n \n War was coming. Though she was a relative newcomer to this world - regarded as an unwelcome outsider by some - she had known this as soon as she had combed through her first history book. For decades - no *centuries* - tensions had been escalating between those seen more as `` beasts'', including the were-variants, and those seen as `` beings'', worthy of basic rights and dignity. With the ever-encroaching presence of humans into werewolf territory, attacks on the uninfected were escalating. \n \n She's always had a soft spot for those who were persecuted - those who suffered from injustice. Seeing a population experience such hatred and prejudice only strengthened her resolve, to become that which, hopefully, she hoped could bridge the gap to help put an end to the were-variants' subhuman status. \n \n Hope can be a powerful motivator, and coupled with her will of steel - her sheer ambition to achieve which most claimed to be impossible - she trained. For years, she studied in secrecy and silence, preparing her body to once again attempt'the change'. She informed only her two closest friends, two boys whom she had developed ties to, and both were open and accepting of her aims. \n \n `` Just think of how useful it would be, being able to turn into an animal and back at will,'' she'd said. `` It could help enormously.'' \n \n The only problem is, she had no inkling as to what kind of animal she would turn *into*. \n \n Unfortunately, even with transformation magic, the final form from'the change' could not be determined with one-hundred-percent accuracy. Whatever animal one turned into was said to reflect his or her personality - or, as some put, `` the soul'' - and others said it was transforming into the manifestation of one's'spirit guide'. \n \n Even before her rigorous self-study and training, she wondered what she'd might be. An owl? She'd always wanted one as a pet and companion since she'd been ushered into her new life. A cat? Now that she had one of her own, and absolutely loved him to bits, she wondered if that would, indeed, be her animal form. \n \n Or, perhaps, she what if she turned into something small, like a mosquito? She wrinkled her nose; she'd had bad experiences with bugs, and never much cared for them. Or, what if she turned into something large, like a whale, or a giant panda? Neither would be very useful or practical to the goal that she hoped to achieve. \n \n However, what she *got* was the last thing she'd expected. \n \n At long last, the day came when she'd decided to attempt a full transformation. She'd gathered with her two best friends in the same room, which was empty, save for the large mirror opposite to her. \n \n Her heart hammering in her chest, she took a good, long look at herself: entirely unimpressive, with normal teeth, average height, a mane of curly, brown hair, a heart-shaped face, and pale skin. She'd never been considered a beauty as a human - at least, by conventional standards - but nor did she feel bothered by her plain appearance. She knew that she could not afford to be distracted by any errant, irrevalent feelings. \n \n `` Who knows,'' her blue-eyed, taller friend joked. `` Maybe you'll turn into something wicked, like a lion. Or, maybe you'll turn out like the Druids ages ago, and become a bear.'' \n \n `` Are you sure you want to do this?'' her other friend queried. `` You know what the consequences could be.'' \n \n She paused, her brown eyes fixating on his green ones with a steely gaze. \n \n `` I'm sure,'' she replied. `` I'm ready.'' \n \n With a deep, loud sigh, she closed her eyes. Her hands were clenched into fists of concentration, her knuckles white. \n \n *'' Anima revelio,'' * she intoned. She flicked her arm over herself, feeling the hum of the magic respond. *'' Reformus animus. `` * \n \n Her stomach lurched, and the room suddenly tilted. \n \n The next thing she knew, she was shrinking in size, her body once again beginning to sprout a coat of thick hair. She could feel her entire body quiver, a sensation of warmth flowing through her as her bones, muscles, tendons, and organs reshaped, and re-arranged, themselves. Her arms, hands, legs, and feet shrunk drastically, and her spine and torso elongated. Once again, she sprouted a tail, her nose shifting into a snout. \n \n After what seemed like an eternity, finally, she opened her eyes. \n \n `` I -'' she tried to say. Instead, a loud squeak came out. This was followed by a more rapid succession of increasingly louder squeaks as she stared at herself in surprise - and horror. \n \n `` Well, Hermione,'' Harry said. `` Congratulations, you've successfully become an otter Animagus.'' \n \n `` With *her* personality? I expected her to, I dunno, become a bird or something, at least. Maybe an eagle?'' Ron chimed in. Much to Hermione's ire - she chittered away furiously as Ron scooped her up in his hands - he looked at her with a ridiculous grin. How dare he! Of course she was still as'ferocious' as ever! \n \n `` I hate to say it, Hermione, but you're absolutely *adorable*,'' he added. `` At least you can attend a support group for cuddly were-beasts.'' \n \n Hermione nipped at his fingers. `` Ow! Bloody hell, what was *that* for?'' \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \n \n *Author's Note: I know it's not exactly in-line with the prompt, but I felt inspired. *\n"}

{"prompt": "`` Do n't you have anything more *interesting* than these parlor tricks?'' \n \n I looked at my customer. He looked a little young", "human": "`` Do n't you have anything more *interesting* than these parlor tricks?'' \n \n I looked at my customer. He looked a little young to be a wizard, but he had the bearing of one. Stage magicians could be rather uptight as well, though. I tried to probe a little more. `` Do you mean interesting magic tricks, or, you know, *interesting* ones?'' \n \n `` What? I mean, something you wo n't find in the first chapter of Baby's First Magic Tricks. Something I have n't seen before!'' \n \n `` Oh, we've got some of those.'' I began leading him to the non-magical side of the shop. `` The more advanced tricks are in this aisle. We have a magic hat that's really popular, there's a lot of tricks you can do with it, and it comes with a...'' \n \n `` *You! *'' Another customer had entered the store behind me. `` Are you the owner of this establishment?'' \n \n Oh crumbs. That guy was definitely a real wizard. He was wearing a robe, for one. I do n't know why, but most wizards just do n't bother with non-magical fashion. They wear robes, or elaborate waistcoats and dresses, or some other fashion that's from the 1800s at the latest. I guess when you have the power to bend reality to your will, you ca n't be caught dead in jeans and a T-shirt. \n \n I turned to greet him with a smile. `` Yes, that's me. How can I help you, sir?'' \n \n He was holding a black velvet bag with a silver drawstring. `` This Bottomless Bag you sold me is defective! I need you to...'' \n \n `` Yes, yes, I understand, come right this way and I'll see what I can do.'' Hopefully I could get him away from the mundane before he said something like `` cast a repair charm on it.'' \n \n We stepped back to the cash register and I took the bag from the customer's hands. `` What exactly is the problem with it?'' \n \n `` I put something in the bag, and now I ca n't get it out!'' \n \n I peered into the bag. The interior was pitch-dark, and when I stuck in a hand, I could n't feel anything inside. Maybe it really was bottomless. He obviously expected there was a way to get stuff back out of it, though. I'd need him to show me how. \n \n I handed the bag back to him. `` Can you try to get your item back, so I can see what's happening? What was in it, anyway?'' \n \n `` Just some writing supplies, thank god. A quill pen, inkwell, parchment...'' He reached into the bag. `` Quill. Pen. Quill pen. Writing utensil. Writing device made of a goose feather. Hello? Are you listening? *Retrievus Contentus! * Give me my pen back, you infernal sack!'' \n \n I nodded to myself. Apparently you were supposed to be able to say the name of an item and have it returned, but that feature was n't working. Unfortunately, I did n't have the foggiest idea on how to fix that. I'd have to fall back on my customer service tricks. \n \n `` I'm sorry, but I get these from another supplier.'' Obviously, since I did n't have any magic of my own. `` I could exchange it for you, and I can repay your losses if it's still under warranty. Did you keep the receipt?'' \n \n He handed over a scrap of parchment, and I scrutinized it carefully. Not just because I wanted to check the warranty; the receipt could provide a lot of clues once you knew how the magic shop's inventory system worked. The wizard who used to own the place put an `` Accountant's Helper'' charm on the cash register and record books, which recorded exactly what was bought and sold in the store. It meant that I had to do the record books with parchment and ink, but the scanning magic it used could reveal details I did n't even know about. \n \n Case in point: The receipt listed the bag the customer had bought as an `` Actually Bottomless Bag with Portal Retrieval and Password Protection.'' That made things clear enough. \n \n `` Aha! I know what the issue is. This was a *genuine* bottomless bag, not a bag of holding. It's a little confusing, since they're both commonly called bottomless bags.'' I hoped that was true. I had a bit of a sense for how magic worked, but I still had to do a lot more guesswork than I was comfortable with. \n \n `` Really? What's the difference?'' \n \n `` A bag of holding simply has an Extension Charm inside of it to carry more items. It still has a bottom, it's just farther away than it should be. A *bottomless* bag uses a spatial loop to remove the bottom completely. You put an object inside and it falls forever, like it's in a bottomless pit.'' \n \n `` Oh, I see! So it can hold an infinite amount of items. And it uses a portal spell to retrieve the items on demand?'' \n \n I nodded. Looks like my guess was right. `` You've got it, sir. But this model of bottomless bag has a Password Charm on it, so someone ca n't steal your items. Do you know what the password is?'' \n \n `` No! I never set a password on this stupid thing!'' \n \n `` Must have happened by accident.'' \n \n `` So how am I suppose to get my things back? Is there a way to reset the password?'' \n \n I shrugged. `` I do n't know, I lost the instructions scroll. But since it's like a bottomless pit, I suspect you might have a simple solution.'' \n \n `` What's that?'' \n \n `` Turn it upside down and wait for your stuff to fall out again.'' \n \n `` Does that really work?'' He turned the bag upside down, but looked skeptical. \n \n `` It should. It would be weird if gravity stopped working inside that bag. I mean, you'd notice something strange when you put your hand inside. It would n't feel like it was still on Earth.'' \n \n `` I suppose you're right.'' \n \n We sat there in silence for a few seconds, waiting for something to happen. The mundane customer paid for the magic hat and left, apparently not noticing or not caring that a man in wizard's robes was intently starting at an upside-down velvet bag. Good, that could have been a mess. \n \n Then a thought occurred to me. `` Oh, you might want to put a Cushioning Charm down, or else...'' \n \n An inkwell came out of the mouth of the bag at terminal velocity, smashing on the floor and spraying ink across the linoleum and splattering on the hem of his robes. \n \n ``... Yeah, that might happen. Sorry about that.''\n"}

On the table next to him was a laptop, left behind by a young boy in dark clothing waiting for his coffee that seemed better suited for dessert than breakfast. \n \n `` I do n't understand,'' Janet said. `` What do you mean I do n't exist?'' She clung to the purse on her lap as if it were a life preserver and pulled the mousy grey cardigan tighter around her shoulders. \n \n `` I *imagined* you,'' Emily said. `` I created you. You ever wonder why no one talks to you? Where do you even sleep at night?'' \n \n `` I sleep in my bed, in my house,'' Janet said. `` And people are just mean. I'm used to being ignored.'' \n \n `` That's because that's the way I imagined you,'' Emily said. `` I needed you to be that way because that's how I was when I was a little girl. Misery loves company after all and if no one wanted to be my friend, I decided to create one.'' \n \n `` Me,'' Janet said. \n \n `` Exactly.'' \n \n `` But I exist,'' Janet said. `` I'm literally sitting right here.'' \n \n `` You do n't exist,'' Emily said, enunciating each word. `` I created you... I just do n't need you anymore. I've changed and you have to go, now.'' \n \n `` I'm not imaginary,'' Janet screamed, pounding her fists on the table. \n \n Emily smiled and waved around the room. Either no one had noticed her outburst or they were intentionally ignoring it. The young boy had seated himself and did n't even offer them a secondary glance. \n \n `` I'm not imaginary,'' Janet repeated, but this time in a quiet voice. \n \n `` Prove it,'' Emily said. \n \n Janet reached for the cup of coffee, but stopped when her hand passed through it. The smug grin that rose to her lips fell to fear. She reached for it again, but her fingers found no purchase. Emily took the cup and raised it to her lips, draining what was left of the lukewarm coffee. \n \n `` But I'm real,'' Janet whimpered. Tears formed at the corner of her eyes and she brushed them away with the corner of her cardigan. \n \n `` I'm sorry,'' Emily said. \n \n Janet chewed on her lip while she thought about their situation, a habit Emily once carried with her until she'd grown out of it. She wiped her eyes one final time before leaning forward and placing the purse on the floor. \n \n `` So for us to move on-'' Janet began. \n \n `` You have to go,'' Emily finished her sentence. `` You always were the first one to figure things out.'' \n \n `` And the cup? Why does n't anyone notice it the strange girl talking to an empty seat?'' Janet asked. \n \n `` I do n't understand,'' Emily said. \n \n `` But I think i do...'' Janet concentrated and the coffee cup appeared back in front of them. Her eyes danced upon the cup and a smile curled at the ends of her lips. \n \n `` You ca n't do that,'' Emily stared at the cup as if it had just sprouted wings. \n \n `` You say you created me in your image?'' Janet whispered. She reached out her hand and picked up the cup, bringing it to her lips. \n \n `` You're not real,'' Emily whispered. `` *I am. *'' \n \n `` Are you sure?'' Janet asked.\n"}

They fell onto the rest of Europe like dominoes, and one by one, the entire European continent was under her control with the promises of power. \n \n Asia was one of the most difficult to take, as the sheer size of their population proposed problems to her. \n \n The Middle East was next, promised with all of the wealth they could receive from their oil reserves, and the promise of keeping western culture out of their lives. \n \n She took all of Africa. That one was the easiest; they were persuaded by the thought of fresh food, clean water, and modern medicine to even the most remote villages. \n \n She nabbed Australia... barely, as she was attacked by some aggressive form of snake while there. In the end, they too fell under her iron rule. The whole eastern hemisphere belonged to her, and it was now time to conquer the other half of he world. \n \n South America was easily persuaded, as was Mexico, Canada, and all of the other countries in North America. \n \n All but one. \n \n The most stubborn, insane country in the entire world, rebelling against her countless attempts to take them over as well.

She greeted warmly, giving him one of the most comforting hugs the man has ever had. Startled, the president began to blubber. \n \n `` I-uh- quite fine, how are you?'' \n \n `` I'm doing just lovely!'' Trump was flabbergasted. A woman as powerful as her was projected to be awful and terrible and cruel- and she was quite the opposite. He found her to be quite lovely, in fact. \n \n After an hour, the two were conversing and laughing like old friends. `` Tell me, uh, how did you manage to get the Middle East on your side?'' \n \n `` It was easy. I just promised them more money from their oil, because they rightfully deserve it I think. I also told them I'd keep you meanies out of their cities!''

Trump asked, lowering his tone and becoming more serious now. \n \n `` Well, if everybody is just nice to each other and works in harmony, we can have such a nicer world!

{"prompt": "*We've lived underground for centuries upon centuries now, yet whenever disaster clearly strikes us in the face, there are groups that insist that we are being", "human": "*We've lived underground for centuries upon centuries now, yet whenever disaster clearly strikes us in the face, there are groups that insist that we are being tested by some higher divine power. It's happened in history, it's happened in present day 2170 and it'll probably happen long past my passing. * \n \n I just landed a new job as an Air Avoidance Agent ( AAA ). Our job is to secure the gates separating our safe underground city from the upper levels, where even the smallest gasp can cause horrors akin to that we've seen during `` World War I'' that was from 1914 to 1918. \n \n This job is often criticized by the common people as `` Kids who are paid way to much to basically sit around all day.'' and in some ways they are right; everybody learned since they were kids that going to the upper levels will kill us, and `` Ascension'', in which we expose those found guilty and sentenced to death, is one of, if not the most gruesome ways to die. The last time we've seen Ascension actually fulfilled was over a century ago, as those who are sentenced to it often successfully kill themselves the very minute the gavel is slammed down. \n \n However the reason our jobs as AAA's are so highly valued is that when problems regarding the upper level *do* arise related to the upper level, we must be ready to lay down our lives for the good and safety of the people. In a way we begrudgingly praised. \n \n Thankfully our days mostly consist of standing watch, occasionally scolding some juveniles who took their games of truth or dare too far and being on the lookout for drug dealers who make small but concentrated doses of `` Assension'' ( the name being a play on `` Ascension'' ), a drug that is hundreds of times stronger than any amphetamines out there. As imagined, it is highly valued in the black market, and those who are dealing often are pawns part of a higher power. \n \n Still, I would take having to deal with kids, drug dealers and drug-dealing kids *any* time over **them**. Who are they, you may be asking? `` They'' are Zephyr. Zephyr is a long-standing religion that believes that the air in the upper levels are *clean*, and that us, AAA's and police, are sent by the Devil of the Earth Terra to prevent them from `` True Ascension''. \n \n The higher up AAA detectives have firmly believed for decades that they are responsible for the recent number of Assension dealers being on the rise. However due to the sheer size of Zephyr, clean slate ( albeit shady interactions ) and political standing of the religion, we have nothing really to tag them with. \n \n I'll never forget that day. \n \n After working as an AAA for a little over a decade, I was only weeks away from retiring at the crisp age of 31; the benefits were amazing - pension was buffered by the government from my service, only paying 10 % of healthcare costs, a free home in the upper-class section of the city, not to mention discounts during Agents Day on pizza, burgers, etc. \n \n I had a loving wife and 2 kids, a boy and a girl. My daughter wanted to be an artisan ( and she certainly inherited the talent from her mother ) and my son wanted to be an AAA agent, inspired by my own upbringing. I've never been so confident and happy in life before. \n \n That day was like any other day; man the third of three gates that separate our city from the upper level and make sure nobody gets in nor out. Due to the first two gates that precede us, days were obviously slow. \n \n The day was early; 5:30am. Of course everything is empty, as it always is. I was sitting back, assault rifle on my shoulder, phone in hand scrolling through Reddit ( which has recently been deemed one of the oldest and still relevant websites in history next to google ) with a nice cup of coffee. I nearly spill my drink as suddenly the large red lights started flashing. I looked over to my co-worker Dave. \n \n `` Do n't worry it's probably just another dr-'' \n \n ***'' ALL AIR AVOIDANCE AGENTS BE ON HIGH ALERT. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. ALL AIR AVOIDANCE AGENTS BE ON HIGH ALERT. REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A DRILL'' *** over and over and over. \n \n `` What the hell is going on?!'' Dave asks me, bewildered and nervous, as we have n't heard that siren in nearly 8 years. I'm just as lost as he is. Could we be at war? Domestic terrorists? \n \n Dave runs off into the other room as I grab my gun and get ready to turn the safety off; if something really is going to attack us, I have to be ready to fight like my life depends on it if I ever want to see my family again. \n \n `` Hey, look at this!'' Dave calls out to me. I set up the automated turret configuration on the wall to attack anything that is n't wearing AAA authorized personnel uniforms and head over to the control room; a small area with a couch, desks with computers, coffee machine and a flat screen TV that the higher ups contact us on to give us the rundown on what's going on, what's to be done, etc. \n \n `` Commissioner, what's going on?'' I ask him. \n \n `` A group of cultists broke into the upper level through the second barrier at 5:15am and sealed off their exit. Several gas masks were found stolen from our inventory as well.'' \n \n `` Cultists?! Just what in the hell are you talking about Richard?!'' Dave asks, his voice shaky and unsure. `` Was n't that just a rumor?'' \n \n `` It's Commissioner... and we thought it was. They are a fanatical, delusional sect of Zephyr called the'Firmamentals' who have distorted Zephyr's teachings and have been actively brainwashing people into believing that they must become'one with the sky'.'' \n \n `` This is just crazy. Alright, even if that was the case, how come our motion sensors did n't catch them if they made it past the first gate?'' \n \n `` That's also why we're on alert; we believe that someone - or a group of people - from the first or second sector might either have been active or sleeper agents, which is why they also knew where to get our military grade upper level masks.'' \n \n `` Jesus Christ. Alright, what do you want us to do, Commissioner? They sealed off the walls already themselves.'' \n \n `` The media no doubt will be on top of this. However if they find out not only about a cult within Zephyr and that this was an inside job, it will hurt our PR and make tensions even worse. We want you and all Sector 3 Agents to work with the detectives and find out who's working with them.'' \n \n `` How do you propose we do that? We're not mind readers you know.'' \n \n `` Just figure it out! We have enough on our plATe already aS It iS oVER HEre.'' it seemed as though his connection was failing. How could that have been? Our connection is secured by the damn government, after all. \n \n Suddenly the screen goes black for what feels like ages. Next thing we know on the screen is a large, open field with green grass, a blue sky, brown trees and even white clouds, just like how the textbooks of older times described them. It was surreal. \n \n We then see somebody wearing one of our masks staring directly at the screen. This person was wearing large, crimson robes with a weird symbol on their chest. It looked like a cloud from the background with a pair of wings that Zephyr had, only upside down. \n \n In the background of the red clothed figure was at least 10 people behind him, all wearing similar masks and robes, only black with the same insignias. They all stood next to one another in such a precise and eerily fashion that it even shook Dave a little. \n \n Suddenly the person began talking. \n \n ***'' I hope you heathens are having a wonderful day today. My name is Julian of the Firmamentals. For eons we as Zephyr's glorious children were oppressed and restricted from becoming one with the sky, but even worse, even led to believe that being in the outside walls are a punishment akin to death! Oh how corrupt the government, the Air Avoidance Agency and the military have all made us so. `` *** \n \n ***'' Alas I am ashamed to say I have watched for decades Zephyr become to dissolve with corruption to the point where their leaders believe we the people ought to oblige by the governments meager sense of power and security that dictates our very lives. To this I say NO MORE! BROTHERS AND SISTERS OF THE SKY, PLEASE REMOVE YOUR MASKS SO WE MAY ONCE AGAIN REJOIN EARTHS EMBRACE! But before so, you ( he says as he points to the person on the far left ) take off your mask so these pathetic infidels may witness our true power. `` *** \n \n And so he does. \n \n He deeply inhales through his nostrils. As he breathes out, Dave and I are in disbelief that he is ok. Suddenly he starts coughing violently. He begs his fellow members for help, but they stay staring at the screen, unfazed aside from the seldom glance of their heads. \n \n As he keeps coughing, eventually blood comes out. His coughing goes on for what seems like ages until suddenly it stops and he is on his hands and knees looking down at the ground. Suddenly a grotesque retching noise is heard, and we watch his own large intestine begin to fall out of his mouth. He falls over and goes limp. \n \n Dave, too mortified, runs over to the garbage can and begins vomiting profusely. The smell is nauseating, but it's justified. Suddenly the limp figure begins twitching. At first it was minor twitches of his fingers and feet but they gradually begin intensifying into full on convulsions. Eventually he is lying on his back and once again stops. \n \n It's what happened next that is one of the few things we'll never un-see.\n"}

A beautiful blend of dandelions, perfectly reflecting the afternoon shower of sunlight. This is where I live. \n \n A young mousy girl with freckled cheeks kneels down behind the falling-apart stone wall, below the drooping tree, in the only small area of darker emerald grass. Fluffy white seed pods stand upright in the summer breeze. She closes her eyes with childhood enthusiasm, forming little wrinkles at the corners, and this is when I begin my glide across the fields, and hover above the girl like an invisible shadow of time. \n \n `` I *wish, *'' she whispers, eyes still pressed firmly closed, `` that my daddy does n't go to Australia.'' \n \n A soft innocent blow swirls from her pursed lips and the white fluff hovers into the air and spreads through the sky, soft pure mother nature against the blue backdrop like a crowd of doves. The little girl opens her eyes and drops the empty stem to the shaded ground. She whisks away in wondrous delight, her giggle echoing right down to the wooden farm in the valley, where a farmer probably smiles at the easiness of life. But now I have a job, and so I shadow-hover away in the opposite direction, for I am the wish. \n \n A knock on the door. The tall slim mother frowns and climbs up from her reposing sofa magazine comfort, and walks over to the front door in bizarre curiosity. She opens it to find two police men, with the red and blue lights flashing behind them. \n \n `` Mrs. Hemmings?'' asks the short one, both with straight faces. Ah, the soul-crushing silent nod of fear in return. \n \n `` It's Mr. Hemmings,'' says the policeman. `` He's... he's been in a car crash.'' \n \n Mrs. Hemmings shakes her head in that awful adult denial. \n \n `` He's *dead,'' * they say apologetically, holding their hats around their groins, not knowing what else to say. \n \n Ah, my work is done here.

They always have each others backs, even if they fight sometimes. And they make me laugh. Watching them always cheered me up. And no matter how many times they fail, they never surrender. They always fight.'' The nurse opened her mouth to argue, but she had to admit the kid had a point..also, now that she thought about it, these particular villains, as far as she knew had never killed anyone.. And it was his last wish. In this world, everyone was so caught up in journeys, battles, tournaments, etc, that many did n't stop to think about the people, who, due to illness, injury, and other afflictions, could not participate in these activities. But this nurse, and others like her, cared above all else about bringing a small ray of sunshine into the bleak futures of these children, wherever it may come from. But they were still well known crooks, and unlikely to serve the needs or wants of anyone but themselves. The boy would likely be disappointed. But she had to try. \n \n A few days later... \n The boy lay in his hospital bed. He was having a rough day. The coughing fits came often. His hair had begun falling out in chunks. He could barely keep any food down. He needed assistance just to get out of bed and use the bathroom. The doctors did n't know if he would ever recover. On days like this, he became overwhelmed with the unfairness of it all. All of his friends were going to school, taking vacations, playing sports... his parents had always told him to enjoy being a kid while it lasted. And so he had. But then this illness... this stupid illness had come and ruined everything. Time did not slow down to wait, so while his friends were living the best years of their lives, that stolen time was slowly slipping away from him. And the loneliness... he was an only child. His father had died a year ago. His mother visited whenever she could, but being single she had to work often to support them both. His friend called every now and then, but they were mostly busy. Watching re runs of his favorite show had often helped him through hard times, but he felt like that would just make him sadder, he knew that offer to meet his favorite characters could n't be possible. It had to be some sort of elaborate hoax... suddenly, without warning, the wide window overlooking the parking lot of the hospital shattered. The view outside was obscured by a mist. A massive shape appeared in the obscuring mist-was that a balloon? A glimmer of purple and red, and two tall silhouettes stepped out of the fog, standing back to back, their features still not quite visible through the clearing smoke. A sinister cackle was heard. No, two sinister cackles. A man and a woman, it sounded like... no, it could n't be... \n \n `` Prepare for trouble... we heard you're unwell!'' said the woman, in a sweet yet sinister voice. \n \n `` And make it double..we thought we'd drop in for a spell!'' continued the man, a ridiculously smooth voice. \n \n `` To protect the world from devastation!'' \n \n `` To unite all peoples within our nation!'' \n \n `` To denounce the evils of truth and love'' \n \n `` To extend our reach to the stars above!'' \n \n `` Jessie!'' \n \n `` James!'' \n \n `` Team Rocket blasting off at the speed of light!'' \n \n `` Get well soon and do n't ever give up the fight!'' \n \n `` Meow, that's right!'' \n\n"}

A proud, confident smile shone", "human": "The Old Man watched from afar as the townsfolk lifted the Hero on their shoulders and marched him through the streets. A proud, confident smile shone from the Hero's face. He had every right to be so proud and confident, the Old Man supposed; he had just slayed the Dragon of the Wastes. And of course, this was after he personally fought back and defeated the Cursed Ones, which was after he felled the Great Golem of the Rock. \n \n Indeed, he had earned this celebration. The townsfolk again would sing their songs, praise his name, laud his victories and immortalize him in legend. Soon, they would ask him to be their leader, their lord, their ruler. Why should n't they? He alone stood up to the mortal danger that threatened the townsfolk and he alone saved their lives on several occasions. The Hero did by himself what no other single person could do. He was a Man among men, a Hero among innocents. \n \n *A Lion among Sheep*. \n \n The Old Man had seen this song sung many times before. Eventually, the Hero would have no more beasts to slay, demons to defeat or monsters to fell. Eventually, the songs would go quiet, the celebrations would cease, and the Hero's glory would be a mere memory. \n \n And the Hero would then act upon the townsfolk's insistence that he be their lord and leader. With no more mortal threats to defend the people from, the Hero would chase the high of his old glory through other means; through means he was not suited for. He would trade the sword for the seat; battle for politics; bravery for diplomacy; love for power. \n \n *Or at least he would try*. \n \n But the Hero is not suited for the position of ruler. Skill with a sword does not necessarily entail competency in ruling. Soon, the Hero would realize the townsfolk can be bitter, ignorant and impossible to please. Soon, the Hero would have to make hard decisions with no correct answer. The Hero would help some number of townsfolk only to discover that in doing so, he adversely affected other townsfolk. The poor and starving folk he fed would get their food from farmers without proper payment or compensation. The thief he hung would be the poor son of a family who was only taking desperate measures to keep them fed and healthy. Those townsfolk would grow angry. Resentment would take root. The Hero would grow frustrated. The universal, absolute love he once enjoyed would diminish. He would forget what brought him to this point. He would become disillusioned; cynical. And on top of it all, old age would begin taking its toll. \n \n The townsfolk would begin calling for him to step down; to remove himself as their lord and leader. But the Hero would see that without him, the townsfolk would tear each other to pieces. Infighting and rivalries and mob justice would rule the town. Without an external, mutual threat, the townsfolk would project their fears, paranoia, grievances and anger at the Hero. And if not the Hero, themselves. \n \n It would only be a matter of time before some foolish, idealistic townsfolk would attempt to assassinate the Hero, imagining a better life and society without his rule, with no regard to who would take his place or how the town would function in his absence. The attempt would fail, of course. The Hero may be many years removed from his glory days, but he would still be thrice the man and combatant of any of the townsfolk. \n \n But this would make the Hero distrustful. The proud, confident smile that once shone from his face would be replaced by a stern and unflinching gaze. Dissent would be met with violence, the smallest of victimless crimes met with punishment by death. The Hero who once slew monsters would become the Monster himself, only this time, there would be no Hero to slay him. Until another external threat arose that threatened the town -- *if* it ever arose -- the townsfolk would forever be at the mercy of their Once Heroic leader. \n \n *And even if a new threat did arise, and even if a new Hero stepped forth to face it, the cycle would begin again. The townsfolk would sing his praises, laud his victories, and immortalize him in legend. And again they would insist the Hero be their new lord, leader and ruler. Again the townsfolk would forget their past; would fail to see the chain of events creating the same problem time after time. Again the townsfolk would be blind to the fact that they themselves are planting the seeds of their own future turmoil and tragedy. * \n \n The Old Man pulled himself from his thoughts, still looking upon the celebration and cheers as a group of townsfolk paraded the Hero around on their shoulders after his latest victory. The Old Man scowled beneath his hood, lamenting to himself that the townsfolk can not see what he can see; that placing so much power and praise and love in a single man is exactly what would bring about their bleak future. Their best future could only be found in themselves as a whole. The Hero as a concept was a relic of the past. If the townsfolk were to ever enjoy happier lives, prosperity, and a better future for their children, they would have to stop turning to the Hero. Their dependence would have to be severed; the cycle broken. \n \n *There would have to be no more Heroes. * \n \n The Old Man adjusted his hood, stepped out from the crowd and slowly approached the townsfolk parading the Hero around. He blocked their path and stood motionless. Soon, the townsfolk saw the Old Man would not move for them. The cheering quieted, the singing ceased and uneasy silence quickly took hold, accompanied only by the calm breeze. \n \n The Hero's smile remained steadfast on his face as the townsfolk let him back on his feet. \n \n `` What is the meaning of this, friend?'' The Hero began. `` Would you not join in the celebration of my latest victory?'' \n \n The Old Man responded by drawing his sword. Muted gasps hurriedly jumped from person to person around them. The townsfolk gave the Hero and the Old Man a large berth. \n \n `` Ha! Alright then, friend,'' the Hero chuckled as he drew his sword. `` I've slain dragons and golems, undead and ogres. Do you really think you will be any sort of challenge for me?'' \n \n The Old Man remained silent. Old he may be, but he had a lifetime of experience. He did not have the strength of his youth, but he was as quick as he ever was and he had found that oftentimes, the experience that had replaced his strength was of more value to him in a fight than his strength ever was. A few seconds passed until the Hero realized the Old Man was not going to respond to him. \n \n The Hero smirked as he lunged forward at the Old Man, swinging his blade with his right arm across the length of his body. The Old Man took a single step back, effortlessly dodging the slash. The Hero followed up with a second swing of his blade back across the length of his body. The Old Man again stepped back to dodge the Hero's slash. \n \n The Hero brought his sword above his right shoulder and swung down towards the Old Man's head. The Old Man parried the blow with his own sword. The meeting of their blades sung a high-pitched song that reverberated across the town square. But this song would only have one note. \n \n As soon as their swords connected, the Old Man spun underneath both of their blades, positioning himself next to the Hero's right, guiding the Hero's sword with his own towards the ground, sliding his blade up the length of the Hero's sword and towards his elbow, slicing off his arm all in one, quick motion. Blood gushed forth as the *clang* from the steel hitting the ground was drowned out by the Hero's cry of agony. The Hero fell to his knees as the townsfolk began to flee indoors. \n \n The Old Man slowly walked in front of the Hero and stood over him. \n \n `` Why...?'' The Hero asked. \n \n `` I was you, once,'' The Old Man began. `` I was the Hero. Then I was the Ruler. Then I was the Monster. I was Savior and Sin. I was Glory and Tragedy.'' \n \n The Old Man pulled back his hood so the Hero could gaze upon his face. Silence returned as they saw themselves within each other. The Old Man saw his past. The Hero saw his future. \n \n The Old Man placed his sword next to the Hero's neck. `` Your death will make you the greatest Hero of all,'' he said. `` And if these people are to ever live better lives, it will give them cause to lead themselves to a more prosperous future. You will die a Hero and the purity of your memory will break the cycle.'' \n \n The Hero's eyes grew wider, but words failed to reach him. The Old Man saw in his eyes that the Hero knew he was right. \n \n *A true hero, * the Old Man thought. \n \n The Old Man took his sword in both of his hands and swung it briskly through the Hero's neck. His head tumbled to the ground as his body slumped backwards. The silence had returned again, this time without the company of the calm breeze. The Old Man pulled up his hood, turned around and began walking towards the edge of the town. \n \n *The Last Hero saved the townsfolk from beasts and monsters and demons, * the Old Man thought. *But they will never know that I just saved them from themselves. * \n \n\n"}

I constantly check your many social media profiles, not just to gaze upon your beautiful face, but to see what new adventure you have undertaken. \n \n I know we have only known each other for a few years, and I wanted to ask you so many times... so often I would be waiting for you, but alas, you always had another man by your side. My pain grew inside me, I knew you were the one, but I could n't bring myself to ask. I should have asked, but that was so long ago. \n \n Last year, when you approached me, eyes gleaming with excitement. Your mouth was trembling slightly and I never had seen you more happy than this. I was so excited, hoping that you at last would fall for me, that I would be your man. But as I steadied your trembling hands, calming you down, I whispered into your ear, `` its OK, everything will be fine Emily''. Then, I felt a cold metallic object between my fingers. What I saw next devastated me. The engagement ring Tim had bought you. \n \n I am sad to say, I was not pleased for you at that moment, jealousy stole my heart for you. And I regret much, not attending the wedding, ignoring multiple text messages, distancing myself from you... I still would check social media, just to make sure you had n't changed your mind. But... I doubted even continuing to try. \n \n I lost track of time, I met a new girl, Sarah, with time I forgot about you. I would drink myself to sleep, crying into my pillow as I watched you grow. Each day you got older and older, and I was without you. Buy Sarah helped me forget. We had such a good time together, Sarah and I would attend musicals, bowl, watch movies, and eventually, I forgot about you. \n \n Then I found Sarah, cheating on me in my own bed. I began to resent her, and in turn, resented myself for trusting anyone but you. I needed to see you, to see your smile, to see your life. But when I checked social media, I noticed you had n't posted in a while. I checked every form of media. I even checked Tim's account, and there I saw another female, one I did not know, based on the ring she was wearing, apparently his fiancée. \n \n I had a chance! You finally were available for me to ask on a date, or two, or four, I wanted be in your life for eternity, and I had a chance after so much time: waiting for you to find me! \n \n I never expected the car crash. My love, lost before I can tell her what she means to me. My own stupidity letting this happen to the only person I care for. Dammit It was my fault, I should have been there to protect you, the thing that means the most to me. Is gone. \n \n I know you will never get this letter, but I needed to say these words to you, and this is the best I can do now. So please, let me finally have peace, let us be together at last. \n \n I'm sorry Emily. I know you would n't want me to, but I must end my torment. I'm sorry Emily. I have nothing left now. Nothing. \n \n Please forgive me.\n"}

Faded and crumpled, I press it against the scarred desk in a feeble attempt to smooth it out. The pale blue lines – especially the dashed ones in the middle – bring a smile to my face. A rare kindness this weekend. I close the lid of the He-Man lunchbox that once held the paper, slide the black suit coat off my arms, kick off my dress shoes, and settle down on the corner of my childhood bed. In the silence of the now empty house, I hear the same creaking springs as when I last slept here fifteen years ago. \n \n The handwriting makes me laugh. Man, when was the last time I used cursive? My pre-pubescent scrawl reads “ Donnie ’ s Things To Do Before Turning 30 ”. My highest goal was apparently becoming a Ninja Turtle. My ten year old self would be so disappointed. As I scan the rest of the list, my amusement turns to sadness, then to a deep sense of failure. Amid the “ go to outer space ” and “ dig a hole to China ” were saner goals like “ get married ”, “ become a famous scientist ”, “ run the Boston Marathon ”, and “ go to college ”. Even simple ones like “ visit Hawaii ” were left unchecked. Not a single goal accomplished. \n \n I look out the bedroom door to the empty house beyond. What would Dad have left undone from his own list? Nothing, I know. He was a doer. Not me, though. I look at the paper in my hand and swallow hard to choke back tears. Determined, I walk back to the desk and grab a pencil. Crossing out “ 30 ” since that ship has sunk, I write “ 40 ” above it and circle a few of the items. *No excuses this time! * If I can ’ t cross these items off, then I ’ m not making a life worth living. \n \n I wipe my cheek and fold the paper up, a sense of real determination washing through me. Opening the rusty lunchbox lid to tuck the note inside for 40 year old me, I stop abruptly. Inside the box is a folded sheet of paper where empty space was not five minutes ago. The paper is creased and faded in an all too familiar way. My pulse quickens as I unfold it, suspicions confirmed as it is the same sheet of paper already held in my other hand. Only now there is a hastily scribbled addendum at the bottom. \n \n “ Don ’ t ask me how this is possible. I have no clue. But listen, Donnie! Do not put on your shoes! There is a poisonous spider hiding in the toe. And it… ” The letters blur and smear together at that point, followed by a single streak that runs off the page. \n \n Fear and confusion paralyze me. What the hell? I look down at shoes in cautious disbelief. Picking one up by the heel, I overturn it and bang it against the ground. Sure enough, a two inch long spider scurries out, seeking new shelter. I jump, falling backwards over the desk chair, hitting the floor hard. But I scramble to my hands and knees and grab the shoe, smashing it down on the fleeing spider ’ s head with an awful squish. \n \n As I try to steady my breathing, I climb back up to the desk and reach for the strange duplicate note. But before my hand can touch it, it fades and disappears before my eyes.\n"}

I stepped closer to the edge, my eyes involuntarily drawn to the drop. The bottom was shrouded by the mist. They said there was a lake at the bottom. I trusted their words, but everything inside of me was screaming at me not to do it. My body refused to step forwards. \n \n `` I'm going to do it!'' I screeched at them, my voice quivering. \n \n They went silent and whispered among themselves. My eyes fixated on the drop. I can do this, I reassured myself, I can do this. I brushed my hair back and turned backwards slightly, giving them a fierce look. At my glance they all fell silent. I gave them a smirk and put one foot over the edge. And then the other. \n \n I fell. \n \n Someone from above screamed. I closed my eyes tight. My stomach seized. I'm going to die! My instincts shouted. Do something! I was n't going to die, I reassured myself, there's water at the bottom. I opened my eyes, determined to prove this point. I could now see the bottom, the fog that had shrouded it before was now surrounding me. \n \n My heart seized up. There was no water! \n \n Those lying bastards! \n \n Those were my last thoughts before I fell into an unconscious state. \n \n \n I was upside down in a fireman's hold. My body was pressed up against some hard and warm. \n \n My eyes shot open. \n \n `` Geez, you're heavy kid'' A voice grunted from above me. \n \n `` Who-who are you?'' I whispered. \n \n `` Randy Muchas, that's my name. I'm your guardian angel. I'd apologise for the shitty job I've been doing, but you kind of piss me off.'' \n \n `` Huh?'' I said dazed. Guardian angel? Those things did n't exist unless you counted those glass angels my Nanna puts up on display. \n \n `` But seriously, why did you try to kill yourself? God you're annoying, grow up. Get some sense.'' He spiralled on. \n \n `` Well, sorry,'' I snapped `` You did n't have to save me'' \n \n He dropped me. \n \n `` Owwww'' I screeched. \n \n I looked up. The guardian angel in front of me was big, covered in muscles. He had a pink shirt on, and green loose boxers. He was looking down on me in contempt, his blue eyes fixated on me. He crossed his arms comfortably across his chest. \n \n `` Stop being a dick. And yes I did. If I did n't I lose my job, and this job gives kickass pay.'' He ranted `` But seriously think of it from my perspective. I was chilling in my room, watching some dance moms, when my fucking P.A. runs in and screams that you, kid-G had just jumped off a cliff. So I had to go fucking save you. And god, you're heavy, did I mention that? And do you know what the worst part is? I still have the old foxtel box, so I could n't even record the rest or pause it. So now I'm fucking missing it.'' \n \n He paused to take a deep breath. \n \n `` Fuck you, kid.'' He finished and disappeared into white smoke. \n \n I fell back in the dirt baffled. What was that? A hallucination? Probably not, I thought to myself, my brain could have thought of better insults. My head was sore, I must have bumped it on the way down. That did n't matter though, because I was alive! I smiled broadly. \n \n There was another poof of white smoke. I coughed. \n \n `` Oi kid,'' Randy Muchas added `` Do n't you dare tell anyone you saw me. Otherwise I'll lose my job and hunt you down. I have n't had human meat \n in a while, it's a rare illegal delicacy.'' \n \n The smoke cleared from around him and he gave me a cruel grin before disappearing again. \n\n"}

Most importantly I had a large thermos filled with the blackest coffee known to man, so black I'd be surprised if any light could escape it's pull. So black that if I showed you a picture you'd swear it was photoshopped.

all manner of lands, only after it had started to affect their own granaries had as little as 10 kings come for and pledged their forces to be used to destroy, every count, duke and king sent the minimum amount of men, and hiring professional sellswords to protect them when those beasts came, your grandfather was one of those poor lads. \n \n he managed to lose an eye and ended up as a guard in some keep for the rest of the war, we used to have his mace round here but your uncle sold it for some pumpkin seeds. \n \n after the orcs came the'age of respite' some fancy word, do n't know what it means, pretty much with all these lord sons and nephews and uncles dead, there was a scramble to replace them, add to that all the deserters from the kings' armies, all the unpaid sellswords, all the starving folk who could n't eat as too many lads went and got them selves killed so they could n't sow as much grain. they say we are stilled cursed for all the kinslaying in those days \n \n \n ay bad times they were \n \n anyway, one of the first places lost to the orcs was the Black King's own land, twas before he was born mind you, could have nipped the orcs in the bud, but everyone would rather look after themselves. \n \n \n he was raised by his families old castellan in all manner of weapons, he became an adventurer like your older brother Oxel, may be rest. \n \n first he was a mercenary, a black knight. with so many lords and ladies arguing over land as their 5th brothers 3rd child was married to someone who had that land 50 years ago had own that land, mea n't they were entitled to it and these minor wars would break out, and always it would be the young peasants to fight, and their lands taken to the torch, \n \n worse still it was the mercenaries that made more from it than the nobles, not wanting to be a cog in a pointless and bloody well he walked the land and became an adventurer killing goblins, orcs, trolls, orges, and all manner of brigand and bandit. he fought great monsters and beasts and became renown for it, he even married who would become his grey queen after ravaging a clan of ogres in her father's land. \n \n \n \n many songs were written about his, well before he made his march to become the King, my favorite is when he threw a javelin and killed a great dragon, it landed right at his feet and he sold it's bones, scales, blood and eyes, to build a castle in his own homeland. then things went a bit sour. \n \n some other lords with very very distance ties to the black king's family tried to take his new land and castle as they believed to have claim over it, it was under the King's impression that this coin had two sides, and took their lands in turn. \n \n \n \n county after county, duchy after duchy, they all fell. some say he recruited well over 1000 knights to his cause, some of these men were 10th or even 20th in line to their houses, so they did n't mind as they did n't have much of a future anyhow, but golly, 1000 knights, that's far more than I could count, with even more footmen than that \n \n \n \n the black march they called it, castle after castle was taken by the king, \n \n \n one such was when a king offered the black king to duel 10 knights in a single day only then he would surrender his kingdom, even offered any of his daughters as a prize aswell, the Black King agreed and after the 10 champion was slewn, the liar king order archers with crossbows in the alcoves above to fire on the the true king, he killed 3 men for every bolt in his back, and they say he took about 13, \n \n I should know I saw him leave the keep after he army took the castle, he took the kings daughters too, had them married to them married off to any of whom they wished of his knights. \n \n \n they did n't do us any harm mind you, they traded some goods, left some men behind as guards for some villages and asked if anyone wanted to join their cause, I was but a lamb in those days, and your grandmother would have split my head with her wooden spoon if I had. but by the gods he was big, 7 foot tall and two men wide clad in black and steel, all manner of spikes and bones on him, took 5 men to carry all his different weapons. \n \n \n now we do n't deal with such problems, no shortage of food means no bandits, no goblins means to raids, no petty nobles who squabble over this and that, we have nobles yes, but their are much more satisfied with their current state of affairs, the king's canals make trading easier, and on king's day every family gets a chicken and every village gets a few barrels of ale, and on that note young one, I think your mother is calling us, looks like the roast chicken is ready, cmon now, time for a feast fit for a king! \n \n\n"}

Brian stayed quiet for a while. `` Yes, yes he was.'' \n \n They walked down the street, neither one of them saying a word. Brian fumbled with his hands, Matt had his hands in the pockets of the torn jeans, staring on the ground and kicking littlè stones around. In front of a big, yellow house they stopped. `` So... This is it.'' Matt looked at Brian, who nodded quietly. `` Yeah. If we are going to die, just... you are an awesome brother. Just remember this please.'' Matt smiled at Brian. `` Do n't get cheesy. We'll manage, somehow. But you're a pretty cool little brother.'' He patted Brian on his shoulder. `` Well, shall we decide?'' Brian nodded reluctantly. `` Shit.'' Brian looked terrified as he realozed he had lost the game of rock-paper-scissors. `` I'm sorry. But you'll do fine!'' Matt tried to smile but he felt the fear pulling him down as well. \n \n It stayed quiet for a long time. Matt almost dared to think that everything was going to be alright. Brian had disappeared in the big white house a long time ago. Nervously, Matt paced up and down like a big cat in a zoo, whose cage is way too small. Suddenly, a loud cry cut through the silence. The fighting could be heard all the way down the street, Matt assumed. /We're fucked./ Finally, Brian came running outside. `` IT DID N'T WORK! GET AWAY, HURRY!'' Matt turned around and together the two brothers ran as fast as they could. Luckily, they had made a plan of where to go if things got out of hand. Behind them, their furious mother came running out if the door, chasing the two boys. Maybe trying to build their own firework and burning down the little garden house down the road was n't a good idea.\n"}

His red eyes, normally unmistakably menacing, nearly welled with tears at the hope of a sleep-over. Mom shifted uneasily. She put down the dish she was drying, and looked Pazuzu up and down, assessing his hulking grey frame. \n \n For his part, Pazuzu did his best to tuck his leathery wings tight to his back. His horns nearly scraped the ceiling, even as he crouched over the table, slurping up cereal. \n \n “ Uh… ” Mom hesitated. \n \n “ Please! ” I begged. “ Pleeeeeaaaaaassssssseeeee. ” Pazuzu joined my passionate pleading. The dissonant harmony of my squeaky 8 year old voice, and Pazuzu ’ s unearthly growling filled the kitchen. \n \n “ Oh, alright. ” Mom finally relented. I jumped up in celebration, and Pazuzu joined me with a triumphant flourishing of his massive wings, bashing into the ceiling and the light overhead. He immediately cowered back down, and cast a sheepish glance towards my Mom. \n \n “ Sorry. ” Pazuzu growled, as apologetically as he could. \n \n ____ \n \n I stood in the dark, the soft lawn cushioning beneath my feet. The world was dark with night, and I gently tossed a small stone at the house window above. Jessica came to the window, her beautiful smile glowing in the darkness. She slid the window open, and silently waved for me to come up. \n \n Pazuzu was pressed tight against the exterior wall, his large wings spread out along the wall, covering the main floor windows. I quickly jogged towards him in my adolescent excitement, and he deftly lifted me up to the second story, and held his hand flat as I climbed into Jessica ’ s room. \n \n Jessica and I embraced in our clumsy passion, and silently slid beneath the covers of her bed. This was our first time, and the air of her small room was thick with our eagerness and lust. I darted a quick glance back to the window, as one of Pazuzu ’ s thick claws gently slid the window back shut. His eyes glowed red as he peered into the dark room. \n \n He contorted his claws as best he could to motion me a thumbs-up, then I saw his hulking frame alight into the night sky, his wings powerful in their silence. Jessica kissed my neck, and I returned my attention to our passion. \n \n _____ \n \n Pazuzu held his hands over his ears. The crying of babies was so high-pitched and harsh, it drilled into his brain. Apparently, the sound was much worse for him than for us humans. But he braved the sound, and the towering flames causing our daughter to make them. \n \n The house was burning, but Pazuzu didn ’ t fear the pain of burning. He had spent a near eternity burning before making his way to this world. He had dragged Jessica and our son out first, and then he had tossed me out through the window as I tried in vain to reach our daughter ’ s room. \n \n My skin carried the shocking electric pain of burns, and I gasped for air. Jessica ran over to me, our son crying in her arms, as flames and smoke towered into the sky. I desperately looked back to our burning house, as long moments passed. \n \n Suddenly, Pazuzu burst through the side of the house, his mighty frame smashing the simple human construction to splinters. In his arm rested our infant daughter, terrified, but unharmed. Both Jessica and I scrambled to our feet, and despite my pain, I scooped our daughter from Pazuzu ’ s grasp. He immediately put his hands back over his ears, the piercing shriek of our children filling the night. \n \n “ I.. ” my voice cracked and gasped, smoke still stinging my lungs, “ I…thank you. ” I coughed hard, nearly collapsing in my exhaustion. \n \n Pazuzu flew off into the dark, covering his ears from the painful cries, as the wail of fire truck sirens rapidly approached in the night. \n \n _____ \n \n Everyone was gathered around my bed. \n \n Jessica held my hand, and the kids and grandkids all looked on with tears in their eyes. The various machines that held me to this world made their various whirring and beeping noises, lending an almost comical insensitivity to this moment. \n \n I felt my heart slowing, my breath fading. I could see Jessica speaking to me, the last loving words of this world. But I couldn ’ t hear anything beyond the whirring and beeping. Whirring and beeping. I felt as though I were sinking down into the sounds themselves. \n \n As my eyes closed, I could see through the window out into the rain, Pazuzu perched on a far rooftop, fearful of this mortal spectacle that he could never understand. \n \n As the light dimmed, and the whirring and beeping drowned down into silence, the last thing I heard was Jessica ’ s profession of love, and Pazuzu ’ s otherworldly cries of confused anguish. \n \n _____ \n \n As the universe inched ever closer to its end, Pazuzu remained perched atop the simple stone monument to my insignificance in the grand order of existence. His scaly skin long ago turned to stone itself, his eyes faded to a dull grey, their fiery red long since dimmed. \n \n While the galaxies and stars sorrowfully blinked out for the last time, Pazuzu maintained his loving vigil, forever by my side, forever my friend. \n \n EDIT: formatting \n\n"}

It was quite large, even rivaling the size of the castle's of old. My lantern blazed upon the walls of marble, the ground, stone. Large rocks were placed all around, containing all sorts of metal and other shining materials that simply glowed with power. Weapons like the Gaster Blaster, a jar of Aether, and the Elfstones, and I can even recall seeing some other objects, like Aegis, the Bag of Wind, and Gleipnir. I oohed at many, but something called to me to one side of the room. I could n't say what it was that made me look in that direction, or even call out to see if anyone was there. There was no point. No one had been here in quite some time. But I pressed on. I shined my lantern around, suspicious of what was ahead. Around me objects glowed like the stars. Any of these could be mine, I thought to myself. The Golden Apple, Loki's staff, nearly everything imaginable. It was mind-boggling, all of these things, and yet I did n't even begin to imagine myself kneeling down to horde the riches that many before me have done. \n \n My legs grew weak from the immense time walking. Turn back, I told myself. Why bother continuing? There's nothing here that interests me. I had a specific taste when it came to these things. I wanted something that would truly tell a tale. So many of these things told and retold, losing their value every time. So many of these things granting immense power, it all seemed so trivial. Why rise to the very top, just to brag? Sure, you could change life in a matter of seconds, everything becoming so trivial, but is n't that the problem? Everything that seems so big to a mere human seemed so small to a God. \n \n `` Who am I kidding? Who would n't want to be a God?'' \n \n \n I kept on going, until very few items were left scattered around me, many things like Triton's Conch, or the Golden Fleece. But, the feeling grew stronger. I knew I was destined to come upon the artifact at some point. \n \n Then, I heard the screams. \n \n Terrible, maddening screams coming from behind me. The sound of hate, anger, and death filled the air, and I knew I was the target. I quickly gathered myself from the journey across the hall, and began in a full sprint. I dropped my lantern, as my running was incredibly impaired with it equipped. They came closer and closer. I could n't turn back. So many of those things that could've saved my life, gone behind me. Slowly, my sickened feeling of the monsters behind me grew to tears. My crying growing louder as continued on, echoed sobs becoming more and more frequent the more I ran. \n \n I had come close to reaching a dead end. \n \n I stopped, and gathered my breath. The horrendous screams grew nothing short of the strength of hurricane, nearly exploding my eardrums from the amount of echos. I looked around, panicked, searching for some way, even though I knew, there was none. Nothing but the darkness of the cave the hall had slowly mutated into. \n \n Then, light began pouring from the back of the cave. From behind a rock, a strong blue glow covered the cave wall, not only revealing a door, but a small sword. I peered over the rock, desperate, and the light nearly blinded my well dilated eyes. As it came into focus, I saw a small elvish sword, engraved with beautiful markings fit for a common elvish swordfighter. \n \n The sword Sting. Excitedly I grabbed it, hoping that it would provide some way of getting me out of this mess. However, quickly, I realized my sword skills were well below sub par, and the number of monsters surely outnumbered me. Frantically, I searched the walls of the cave, the screams just below a small cliff I had climbed before reaching it. Eventually, I had traced my steps back to where I had found Sting, making my last ditch effort to fins some sort of help. \n \n And sure enough, beside it laid a small golden answer to my problems. \n \n I smirked, wondering how it ever had gotten there. Turning around, I say the first couple of orcs climb the cliff to see me. \n \n And then see me disappear. \n \n *** \n \n If you made it this far, thanks for reading!

Their helmets gave them the appearance of half-melted human skulls, the dark gaping grins lending a maddening aspect to their visage. Red rags were tied around their sleeves and legs, and hung from the slings of their demonic looking weapons, their color due to to being dipped in the blood of their foes. Saw backed blades lay sheathed in scabbards at their waists and tucked into their boots, fearsome looking things that only enhanced their reputation for mindless violence. On several of their backs were tanks of super-concentrated fuel, the means for giving their flamethrowers terrible life. Others carried rocket tubes or heavy demolition charges; weapons against any vehicle or emplacement they might come across. Their leader was dressed much like the rest of them, only the amount of trophies and the deadly looking Long Lance fusion blaster labeled him as the senior Pyro-Drake of their number. He pushed up his helmet at the sight of their pilot descending down the small staircase into the hold. \n \n `` Should n't you be flying this thing?'' Asked Verien Oshen of the Molten Anger Monastery, his helm pushed up to reveal scarred flesh. \n \n Tomess Ghast smiled from beneath the pilot's helmet he wore, dark green with the Alliance Starbird in yellow. \n \n `` I'm letting Lieutenant Nay'tu try her hand at the controls.'' \n \n The burned Pyro-Drake raised a brow, the actually hair long scorched away. \n \n `` You're letting the lass fly the *Red Wake? * Either you've gone soft over the years or else you've truly lost your mind.

We may na' be Death-Falcons, but I dare say we'll reach the ground in one piece, just do n't crash us with that cat o' yours at the helm,'cause once we'd be reborn in metal, I'd thrash your tin ass until oblivion.'' \n \n Commander Tomess Ghast laughed at that and clenched the forearm of his friend and comrade. \n \n `` Die well.'' \n \n Verien Oshen returned the handshake. \n \n `` As should you.''\n"}

I tried creeping around bars, but I am constitutionally inept in public places -- I tried online dating, but unfortunately my words are far prettier than my face. I finally got to the point where I started hitting up old high-school acquaintances, and I've been working my way sadly down the list. \n \n Today I arranged to meet with one of those, with a familiar old Rebecca, at a coffee shop. It's always awkward to see someone again after fifteen years, when you never knew them very well to begin with -- I always start these conversations by vaguely trying to recall the teachers that we had together, and the final impression they left on us. Me and Rebecca talk about Mr. Lucas for a while, and about the time he had to have a substitute come in because he passed out while vomiting on the toilet and got a concussion. The kind of shared memory that really bonds two individuals, even after fifteen years. \n \n I'm pleasantly surprised by the condition of her face -- she's aged remarkably well. I wo n't tell her that, it's not appropriate. But I do feel compelled to bring up the overwhelming cross that she's wearing around her neck, since I do n't recall her as being religious. \n \n `` Rebecca,'' I say, `` what is this monstrosity around your neck?'' It looks like a piece of driftwood, nailed to a fragment of a railroad tie. The chain is, by necessity, thicker than my index finger ( admittedly, I have small hands ). I do n't mean to be rude, but it does seem rather much for good taste. \n \n She says, `` Oh, this. I have to wear this. God told me to.'' \n \n I breath in and breath out. I do n't mean to be an overbearing atheist, but often I am. If we lived in a world without etiquette, I would have gladly walked away at that moment. But out of obligation, and perhaps out of a small curiosity, I tried to make conversation out of it instead. \n \n `` God told you to? He talks to you a lot?'' \n \n `` Only recently,'' she says. \n \n We're getting to the core, already. She's had some sort of traumatic episode within the past few months, it's messed up her mind, and that's why she's on the same pathetic trajectory as I am, of surveying forgotten acquaintances. I say, `` Well how did that start?'' \n \n She says, `` Well, I never used to be religious at all, but I spent a lot of time at the hospital. I was very sick, but God helped me.'' \n \n `` If it's not too much to ask, what were you sick with?'' \n \n `` Appendicitis,'' she says. `` I'd been in pain for so very long. I lost a lot of weight ( I'd noticed ), I felt nauseous all the time. But I did n't think anything was really wrong until it ruptured. I almost died, but they were able to remove it all. \n \n `` God appeared to me that night. He was holding my appendix in his right hand and he said,'Daughter of Eve, you've been cleansed of your sins. You must make a cross, and wear it. And thou shall live a holy life.' I've been wearing this ever since. And I've been so much happier, I really have.'' She takes a sip of her coffee, as if to emphasize the point. \n \n I am reaching my limits. I say, `` What kind of God would soil his hands with an infected appendix? Do you know what causes appendicitis? Fecal blockage. It's a strange kind of god that would n't at least put a sterile glove on before picking that thing up. Was he wearing a glove? Do you remember?'' \n \n She's taken aback. She says, `` No, I uh... No. No glove.'' \n \n `` Well see, that's why I do n't believe you.'' I stand up, very much wanting to be done with the whole ordeal. `` It's been a pleasure, Rebecca. And be careful around wood chippers. If that thing gets sucked in, it will take you with it.'' \n \n I am surprised to see, as I begin to turn away, not a look of disdain, or hurt -- but compassion. \n \n\n"}

We met at the CSIS main office and have been seeing each other for month before I had worked up the courage to ask what section he was in. I was just a translator, and he was a mystery. But I could n't utter my next thought due to the unmistakable clatter of gunfire. Greg poked his head over the planter we were now cowered behind. \n \n `` Well, they did say Edmonton was a target.'' \n \n `` Who?'' \n \n `` Sam, it was on the news; ISIS and all that. Radical Islam and blah blah blah.'' He was cocking his Browning 9mm and checking his spare magazines. `` Do you have anything?'' \n \n `` Spare panties.'' I offer up half joking under another volley of shots and screams. A woman is gunned down a couple of feet from our hiding place, and I almost scream, before a hand covers my mouth. \n \n `` So that thing about being observant; I knew they would be here, and I knew the woman in the sweater was the watcher. Even terrorists need money, and they will use this attack to cover massing funds. What they need the money for we can only speculate-'' he peeks over the planter and can barely fire before screaming `` RUN!'' And unloading a mag into the moving mass of masked murders. Looking back it may have only been 10 or so. \n \n We stop in a service hallway where we find a dead security guard. I close his eyes and say a few words while Greg frisks him \n \n `` He still has his gun.'' He says holding it out to me.

He is well practiced at this surreptitious art and, from what he can tell, she really does have a knockout body, all the more enhanced by her slinky walk. \n \n Amazingly enough, she is heading right for him. \n \n He is convinced that she means to walk past him, not to him. Even when her high heels stop dead behind him, his eyes remain glued to the glass, taking in her lines and curves to the last. \n \n Then a smart voice, with a hint of sultry, says, “ Geez, the last man standing is you? ” \n \n He's not quite sure what she means by that, but he wants to turn around, smile, and tell her that, technically, he is the last man sitting. But he is Edison Periwinkle, and Edison Periwinkle does n't say that sort of thing around women. Edison Periwinkle says things like: \n \n “ Huh? Excuse me? ” \n \n A light giggle. “ Not much of a talker, are you? Well, that's fine, I'm not really in the mood for talk anyway. ” \n \n He has no idea what she's going on about, and he lapses back into silence, a doughy mound in expensive ill-fitting clothes, huddled over his glass. His palms are sweaty, as Edison notices that her reflected hair looks vaguely like Mom's spaghetti. Then he nearly jumps out of his shoes as the trace of a fingernail runs a track along the blades of his back. \n \n “ You ever wear a blindfold, mister? ” \n \n Under her spell, he shakes his head, hair standing on end. \n \n “ Oh, a first timer then. Well then, may I? ” \n \n Goosebumps and double meanings abound. Surely a knowing smile on her part, as he hears the rush of silken cloth free itself inside a pair of hands. He then realizes she has asked a question, and he answers with a stilted nod. \n \n His world goes soft and black, and then he goes spinning as inhuman strength hauls him off the stool and onto the bar counter, accompanied by a terrific crash of shattering glasses. Then her smooth warmth slides onto him, straddling him. She is by no means a heavy girl, but she feels heavy to him nonetheless because he's never had a girl on top of him before. \n \n This has to be a joke. A practical joke of the highest degree. Candid camera of sorts. Most elaborate setup ever. No other explanation. \n \n As she undoes his belt buckle, he whispers, “ Who are you? Why are you doing this?? What's going on?? ” \n \n She answers by yanking his belt free and tossing it aside. \n \n “ What about everyone else here, for christ's sake! ” \n \n A pleasant laugh which chills him to the bone, telling him this is all for real. “ Do n't worry, baby, all they can do is watch. ”\n"}

Now losing a week long fight with delirium, mostly due to the lack of food, Chuck was talking to his Pokemon again. It was a Koffing this time, and he was speaking in the voice of John Candy. \n \n `` That's the last food you ate?'' Koffing asked. He seemed quite concerned. \n \n `` I'm pretty sure man...,'' Chuck rasped. He stretched, cracking his back against the weight of his pack. It was mostly full of USB battery packs, that he would charge at any generator he happened to find. You see, Pokemon GO, a phone app, was the only source of entertainment he had. \n \n An apocalypse had occurred, the origins of which are n't really essential to our story. Chuck's family had died. His friends had died. His boss had died. To make a long story short, no one was around any more, as far as Chuck could tell. However, for whatever reason, Pokemon GO still worked. \n \n It was a phone app, where a dude or dudette could run around catching digital pokemon. Chuck did n't take the time to question why his LTE was still working or who was paying the bills, he just walked, cursed pidgeys, and walked some more. \n \n Chuck swiped his finger to the right and his Koffing was gone, replaced with a map. Pinching his fingers, the map shrunk and zoomed out, allowing Chuck to see more of what he was to explore. However, this time, something was different. \n \n His heart pounding in his emaciated chest, Chuck beheld the first lure he had seen since the Apocalypse. A lure was a something you set out to attract pokemon. But someone had to set it up. A person. Someone else. \n \n Chuck mustered whatever energy he had, and half waddled, half lurched forward at his most fervent pace. The road was bordered by tall trees, and he could not make out what lay at the pokestop around the corner, or what may be in store for him at the lure. \n \n `` People! `` Chuck actually cried aloud. Although, in his decrepit state, it came out as more of a strangled gurgle. He rounded a bend, and as he did, the toe of one of his sandals caught the back of his ankle, sending him tumbling forward. His sack of USB packs fell over his head as he rolled. \n \n Then Chuck heard gunshots. He had never heard gunshots before, in his job as a pizza delivery driver, however the thunderous roar was unmistakable. Chuck did n't move, lying there prone as his pack slowly leaked battery packs onto the ground, out of a couple fresh bullet holes. \n \n `` Look Larry, battery packs!'' Chuck heard a voice call. And then, as the last gunshot Chuck would hear echoed through the valley, he realized the lure had n't been for Pokemon.\n"}

Nok fired her pistol, but missed the discs that arced across the sky. \n \n `` Romances are still a genre. People still feel love. Nobody makes up science anymore.'' Aung waved her pistol haphazardly at Nok. `` Just call it magic.'' She shot again and the holodisplay rang out excitedly. `` Look, you're thinking too hard about it. You did terribly this round.'' \n \n Nok holstered her pistol in the machine and it enveloped it back into storage. She shrugged, and turned away to see if anything else in the arcade caught her eye. Aung grabbed her hand as they ambled through the game machines. \n \n `` But is n't magic just a simulacrum of advanced technology? Clarke always said-'' \n \n Aung cut her off. `` That was centuries ago. Magic is just a crutch to ignore the laws of physics.'' She sniffed. `` Nobody wants to read about something that will never happen. If it could n't possibly happen, then who cares?'' \n \n `` Would n't it be cool though? To.. To.. To imagine a world where anything is possible? Every book ca n't just be about humans and boring Earth colonies sitting around boring mid-range suns.'' \n \n Aung rolled her eyes. `` Oh so we're just going to invent a whole race? What will they be called, space-elves? Star-Dwarves?'' Nok let out an exasperated sigh and pulled her towards the exit. They walked out and she paused to look up at the shielded vacuum of space above them. \n \n `` Do n't... Do n't you ever wonder if maybe there's something more out there?'' She squeezed her hand. \n \n `` No, Nok, because it's been centuries. There's no one and nothing out there but more matter waiting for us to realign it. It's just stars and space dust with varying levels of entropy all the way down.'' \n \n She sighed again and Aung pursed her lips. `` Well,'' she said, `` if you did write science fiction, what you write about?'' \n \n `` Oh... I... do n't know.'' She turned away slightly. \n \n Aung laughed and pulled her closer. `` You do, I know you.'' \n \n She blushed. `` I wanted to write about an armed spaceship. Like, they've been cast out from their home - which is at war, a really bad war - and then they're running away, right? Because they defied orders or something.'' \n \n `` Mhmm, okay.'' \n \n `` And then they're out there and they discover an alien artifact. It's an ancient device they find on an abandoned planet, totally in ruins, but it still works. An alien appears and asks them what do they want more than anything in the world, and they say, to stop the war, so it sends the ship back in time-'' \n \n Aung smirked. `` Shush,'' Nok said before she could say anything, `` They go back in time, and then they're like... Back right before the big civil war that's destroying their home, so they try to stop it, but... But somehow, they're the ones who start the whole war.'' \n \n `` Well, at least it's not a paradox,'' Aung said dryly, `` At least that's scientific.'' \n \n `` It's just an adventure story, I guess.'' \n \n `` Then why have time travel in it? Everyone knows you ca n't go back in time. You might as well have a wizard wave his wand,'' Aung waved her hands as if casting spells. `` Kapow, you're back in time. Pew, you're in an alternate universe. Zap, you're an alien.'' \n \n Nok pushed her away. `` Stop it.'' Aung stopped with a martyred look. `` It's not funny.'' \n \n `` I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I just do n't think the nets will read it.'' \n \n `` It's different, okay?'' Nok paused and looked back at the grand expanse of stars that stretched out above them. \n \n `` It's not the best idea, I know. But fantasy and magic.. That's about humans, doing human things, that are fantastical and unreal. But... But... That's so insular. That's always about who we are removed from our worlds.'' She stopped again. `` I... I want to write about something outside of ourselves but carries part of us with it. It's so lonely... Being the only things out here. Humans are too comfortable.'' Still staring upward, she reached out for Aung. `` If it's just us, making a space civilization all by ourselves, spreading across the galaxy one habitable system at a time, there's nothing to remind us about what's bigger than ourselves.'' \n \n She looked back down into her eyes. `` We're small, you know? We're just cyber-organic creatures crawling around this incredible canvas, but it's not art. It's not beautiful for the sake of being beautiful. It's so... scientific.'' Aung smiled, and Nok kissed her quickly. \n \n `` Science can be more than just physics and numbers and... I do n't know, things that make us feel comfortable. Science fiction is n't about the science or the fiction, it's about what makes science beautiful. All this order, all these laws and rules that define everything, sometimes it's more beautiful to break them. We need to remember what happens when science goes too far, or not far enough, and remind ourselves that we are more than just sentient space dust.'' \n \n `` We need a bit more asymmetry, Aung. Everything is such a perfect reflection of what we know it to be, I just want to write about some cracks in the mirror.'' \n \n Aung hugged Nok, and brushed her lips against her cheek. `` Well, that was beautiful,'' she whispered. `` If you write like that, maybe science fiction could make a comeback.'' \n \n They both looked up at the thousands of tiny lights. `` Time travel is still stupid though,'' she said softly. Nok punched her lightly in the ribs, and Aung let the silent vastness overwhelm them for a moment longer. \n \n\n"}

As such, since Heaven and Hell are based on old-age ideas and have, for all intents and purposes, never been conquered by any entity or experienced culture clashes, their formations and names would remain the same. \n \n On a side note, if you're trying to write something about Heaven and decide to give them rifles and machine guns, there is a role for even that. Given that Judaism experienced countless disporas and Christianity taking the spotlight during Roman times, we could designate Roman titles to each soldier/group. \n \n Your rifles would be your bread and butter troops: Legionary. \n Snipers: Velites. \n Sapper: Princeps or Hastati \n Medic: Medicus \n Light Armored: Sagittarii \n Armored: Ala quingenaria \n Heavy Armored: Cohors equitata \n \n The list goes on and on. I do want to note that while all modern day nations have things like 1st Rifles or 1st Division, the concept of 1-9 is a Indo-Arabic invention meaning you would have to use XI Legio. \n \n On a second note, if you're looking for modern/post-modern military units for Egyptian/American/Russian, it's actually pretty simple. Because of history, space-based troops would still be called Marines until a reclassification was done ( which is extremely slow anyways ). All unit strengths and numbers are pretty similar around the world with each unit having specific tasks. \n \n A Russian artillery division will be no different in form nor function than a US artillery division. In addition, an anti-armor division will still be anti-armor. If, for whatever reason, you have a bunch of marines floating around in space with a giant metal tank thing, the guys armed to rip that tank thing apart would still be called anti-armor. The guys firing a giant cannon across the world to hit a group of other floating marines would still be artillery.\n"}

Her body had begun to change and she requested that she needed more", "human": "I slept in the basement because I could no longer share a room with my sister. Her body had begun to change and she requested that she needed more privacy and that the room was too small for two people anyway. I had no problem; the basement was large enough for me to do jumping jacks before bed without knocking something over. In the time I had begun to sleep in here, I had gained a considerable amount of muscle. \n \n It was pleasant when the lights were on because they were really bright and gave more life to whatever they touched. The bicycle from the 1920s, the mangled car parts, the unused carpets. They comforted me as I did pushups but when I switched the lights off, and slid into my bed panting, they became enemies. \n \n It had begun from the first night I had moved down here and it had never taken a break, not even once, the feeling as though an earthquake was ravaging my bed and it was my bed only because nothing else looked as though it had been affected by an earthquake in the morning. I did n't disclose this to anyone else in the house; they would n't believe me anyway, would think I was just scared of sleeping alone in the basement. \n \n But today I had prepared myself to find the courage and look below my bed to whatever was there. Perhaps it was a raccoon, its foot stuck between the springs. Or maybe a cat that had come in for shelter when it had gotten dark outside. \n \n \n I took in a deep breath and *looked*. \n \n Two large yellow eyes stared. I held back a scream because I was a man and a man who slept alone in the basement at night. \n \n `` Hello,'' I said. \n \n `` Hello.'' \n \n A voice that rumbled, not unlike that of my Maths teacher. \n \n `` Why are you under my bed like that?'' I was surprised, proud to find that I sounded curious and not terrified. \n \n There was a pause before a reply from the deep voice. `` To protect you.'' \n \n I turned on the lights and together we moved the bed. He was the size of a small chimpanzee but had purple fur and two horns protruding from his ears. He explained that each night a hole opened underneath my bed and it was deeper than anything I could imagine. From the hole spewed demons and abominations who kidnapped children for their master's broth. \n \n `` And he cooks them alive, too'' said the monster with a grave matter-of-factness. \n \n I was silent for a time and then I said, `` So what now then?'' \n \n `` I'm going to show you how I do it, wrestle demons. I'm sure *you* would want to spectate such.'' \n \n * \n \n He woke me a minute before anything happened. He stood over the hole and waited. And then he slammed himself to cover the whole and prevent the clawing creatures from escaping the Underworld. They were quiet in their wrestling, although their bodies flailed and convulsed. It was a wonder how my bed had not shaken more. I did n't rush forwards to help the Monster because he had told me to stay in the corner. \n \n Perhaps the reason why I did n't scream was because I thought it had all been a dream. Or because I thought men did n't scream for help, they helped themselves. But one of the demons broke loose and glided, almost gracefully, fangs and flaming eyes bared, and snatched me away, past the Monster's hopeless efforts and down the hole to the depths of the Earth. \n \n And when I resurfaced, the screams of a thousand children intertwined with the echoes of the Monster's haunted wail. \n\n"}

Central and Hannigan both took poundings from the noon wave, and the incendiaries have got the fire watch plenty busy. We really need the public to stay clear this afternoon while they work.'' I just shook my head, but she snorted with disgust and stalked off like it was a personal affront from the Archduke. Who knows? Maybe when I've seen a couple more decades of warfare I'll feel more like she does too. \n \n So now I was walking home along Ramsgate boulevard ( only a few of the buildings were burned here as yet ), and I looked toward the northern military complex. Surrounded by bulwarks of thick stone, the complex protects the approach to the mountains within which our own magnetic torpedo launchers are stored. \n \n I could see soldiers in full armor walking the walls, but aside from two who man a pair of spy glasses, searching the sky for incoming, they have little to do. There was a time, my grandfather told me, when we took some comfort at how quickly a barracks full of their brethren in arms could deploy throughout the city if the enemy came, but since the torpedoes were invented, warfare is all conducted from afar now. Never thought we'd see the day. \n \n Now, there in the mountain complex are the long metal tubes lined with half a mile of carefully woven electromagnetic coils over well oiled tracks. When I and some of my fellow civilians heard the familiar hum of the electric powered magnetic coils charging up, we paused, and looked up at the compound, waiting for the show. \n \n Moments later a barrage of magnetically accelerated torpedoes emerged from the hillside, their short stubby wings guiding them on carefully chosen paths while keeping them aloft for the twenty six mile trip across the border where they will pound the enemy's nearest cities with our own magnesium ignited oil payloads, hopefully burning down some of *their* buildings to get back for some of our own. \n \n `` Give'em hell, boys!'' a middle aged man beside me said, and several of us nodded our agreement as we watched the torpedoes shooting away out of sight almost faster than the eye could follow. \n \n Years ago, when I was back in school yet, I listened while one of my classmates prattled on about how these new terror weapons would soon put an end to war. `` Think about it,'' he had said, `` No more swords, no more crossbows, no more *seeing* your enemy coming across the field of battle. Just BLAMMO, death from above, any time, no warning. Cities burning, and you ca n't stop what you ca n't see coming. Who's gon na want to keep that up? You'll see!'' \n \n Yeah, sure. Thing is, even though you'd never get me to admit it today, there was a time when I actually thought maybe he was right. But each year just brings more sophisticated torpedoes with bigger payloads that burn hotter, or maybe throw shrapnel when they crash down. And we respond with more tunnels in the mountains, and better torpedoes of our own. If I were talking to my friend today, I'd tell him he was an idiot, and how nothing stops war. Nothing. \n \n I shook my head. Show was over. It was time to get home before night falls. \n\n"}

They were n't familiar with the concept. \n \n As the next hoard arrived, we did them the favour of disabling the force field simply to save them the humiliation of dying in the colds of space.

Maybe that had been their plan all along, to make us turn against ourselves. \n \n Nah. They were stupid. \n \n There were scenes all around the area where the humans had landed. Some quickly bagged one up for themselves to see how they were with a bit of seasoning and marinate in them. Extremely bitter, it turned out, with a tinge of saltiness.

I'm honestly worried for my safety, what could he possibly be doing? Scouting out a burglary? In addition to this, I'm pretty sure that guy's a pedophile. \n \n The worst part, however, is my neighbor. My neighbor is the most annoying and disgusting person you'll ever lay your eyes upon.

To be honest, I'm not sure how I could have survived this town if I had n't met Tom. \n \n Tom's a lovely guy. He comes over for brunch everyday and we talk for hours.

He did n't want to deal with this. Not now. Not after the week they both'd had. All the same, his son did n't seem like he was going back to sleep any time soon, not until his fears were assuaged, at any rate. Ian walked over to the window and peered out into the back garden. The sky was dark, not a star in sight, nor was even a sliver of moon visible against the velvety black. It was had been raining all night and the clouds were still thick. The yard was dark and the only light came from what filtered throuh Alex's bedroom curtains. Despite this, Ian could still spot the source of the scratching noises. Sandra, his wife and Alex's mother, was standing just a few feet from the window. \n \n Upon seeing him standing in the window, she started scrabbling at the sill and the frame, trying to open the window. When she could n't, she stared pleadingly into her husband's eyes. It was freezing outside, the rain was starting to come down again, and she was soaked to the bone. Ian stared back at her and the minutes stretched on for what felt like ages. Then Alex spoke again, his little voice breaking the trance. \n \n `` Daddy, what's out there?'' \n \n Ian shook himself, then drew the curtains closed. `` Come on Buddy,'' he said as he turned around and picked his son up, `` You can sleep in my room tonight.'' Alex was more than happy with this offer. He clung happily to his father as Ian carried him to his room and tucked him in. The television that sat on top of his dresser did n't get cable, so he put in one of Alex's favourite DVDs. The little boy dropped off to sleep within minutes. That was good; Ian could hear Sandra scratching at his window now, still trying desperatly to get into the house. \n \n He was n't going to be sleeping that night, not while knowing she was out there. Instead, he'd be up the rest of the night, waiting for dawn and the rising of the sun. He'd take Alex to his mother's house down the street, and then he'd go pay Sandra a visit. This could n't keep happening. It had been a week. She could n't keep coming back like this. Sooner or later Alex would realize what was happening. \n \n *I should have buried her at a crossroads*, Ian thought as he settled deeper into the pillows and tried to ignore the scratching. He knew what the risks would be after that damned cat had jumped over Sandra's body. His father had insisted that they cut her head off to be safe, but Ian could n't bear the thought of doing that to her. She had been the love of his life and the mother of his child. Besides, the legends were just legends. That's what he had told himself. The stories were just stories and the dead did n't come back. \n \n Well, he was wrong.

Shit-a-smartphone-and-shove-it-up-my-ass news. Call-the-president-news. \n \n *Particles are talking*, she thought, fast stepping her way through the long, white corridor that lead back to the \n LHC's main hall, where her team – Dr. Pratt's team – awaited. \n \n *Particles saying'Go no further*, she thought. People were going to think it's God, she was sure. What with all that \n Higgs Boson'God Particle' bullshit, even. People would definitely think it was God talking to us, humans, from the LHC. \n \n Sarah knew the truth was, much more likely, that this was an attempt of communication by another species. Alien. \n Maybe from the future? Who knew? \n \n Not that this made the news boring in any way. In fact, Sarah always figured aliens were way cooler than God. \n \n But there's no way people would n't think this was God saying science has gone too far, she was sure. Religious folks, they are dying for a reason. People see Jesus in toasts, for Christ's sake. There was going to be protest. People will demand they stop. Demand they close the LHC. Demand they do exactly the opposite of what Dr. Pratt had just ordered her to do. \n \n *Which is why he told us to run it again before calling the president*, she figured. Pratt was a brilliant man. \n \n Utterly insane, of course, and weirdly found of Brie Cheese. But brilliant. \n \n `` What's the word, Sarah?''

Everyone in the room was standing still, staring at her. \n \n `` Run it'', she said, and cheering ran all across the room. `` He says run it again.'' \n \n `` Right away, ma'm'', Deckard answered, with a smile. Sarah made way to the second floor balcony, climbing the \n metal steps two-by-two. Barely able to contain her own excitement – but making a point to look professional to \n everyone she passed by – she found her way across the open corridor to the far edge. She leaned against the rail to \n watch the show. \n \n The room she was in was large and circular, like a gigantic hollow penis. \n \n *This is a terrible way to describe this room*, Sarah thought. It was, in fact, large and circular, but not like a \n hollow penis. It was more like you'd imagine the setting for a boss fight in Metal Gear Solid would be. A wide, computer-filled first floor, topped by a circular metal balcony that ran all around by the wall it twenty feet up. Sarah was standing on the edge of this second floor balcony, watching as the team prepared the collision. \n \n `` Quite a view'', she heard, from behind her. \n \n `` What? Oh, hi, Dr. Pratt.'' \n \n Pratt leaned next to her, biting onto a piece of white cheese. `` Brie?'' He asked. \n \n `` No, thanks'', Sarah answered. \n \n `` I would n't have given it to you anyway. Do n't you sometimes feel like life has no purpose and you could murder a \n child randomly and, in the great scheme of things, it would n't matter at all?'' \n \n `` What?'' \n \n `` I said I like the spring weather'', Pratt said, smiling. Sarah shrugged, shaking her head with a smile. She had learned long ago to ignore the Doctor's weirdness. Everyone in the lab had. Dr. Pratt was weird. Really weird. \n \n He once adopted a cow and kept it in his office for two months. A full grown cow. \n \n Once he screamed for twenty minutes at a pencil sharpener. In Latin. And he does n't know Latin. \n \n During the year of 2010, he did n't speak vowels. \n \n Dr. Pratt was weird. A genius. But a weird one. \n \n `` All set'', came a voice from downstairs. `` Ready? Three… Two…'' \n \n Sarah glanced at the Doctor. He had his eyes fixed on the mainframe downstairs, chewing onto the cheese. \n \n `` One… Go!'' \n \n Off it went, with a loud hiss noise. The big screen downstairs flashed alive in white. For the first few seconds, nothing happened. \n \n Then a loading screen. The collision was complete. Sarah glanced at Dr. Pratt again. The Brie was over. \n \n Onscreen, words appeared: \n \n `` For fuck's sake, guys. I'm coming down there.'' \n \n Then, after a few seconds: \n \n `` This is God by the way.

Everything that once mattered lost its static seriousness. Slowly he ’ s wrapping his head around the reality that everything changes; nothing dies or is born. He was once something else and will live on forever in a multiplicity of forms and beings that all share the same inner core. \n \n And the man just realized that what he knows as “ himself ” is that inner core. The truest part of him, not the part that knows but the watcher in the back that knows that he knows. Ad infinitum. The more he steps back from his own ego, the more he realizes that he could keep on stepping back forever, that he ’ ll never fall over into the abyss. \n \n But then… then, the doors start closing. The certitude of this newly discovered world gets cloudy as he ’ s slowly coming back into place, into his own life like a puzzle piece. As reality gets more and more familiar, recognizable, the one he knew for 19 years, the memories he closely identifies with, the people who love him, the idiosyncratic personality… \n “ I ’ m me now. I ’ m back ” He reassures his girlfriend: he was acting scary while his mind was on the other side. His body did not follow. One can be having visions of eternal truth and beauty while drooling like a baby. \n\n"}

Someone has taken the second binding charm, ” Dost repeated. Her rage was nothing new, so he remained stone-faced as she swore, obscenities flowing to spells as the unformed magic flew about the room. Any bystander would likely be cowed by the scene. \n \n “ I want whoever has those charms found! ” the witch shrieked. “ They are the only things that can halt my plans; I will **NOT** allow them to stop me! Is that clear?! ” \n \n Dost bowed, “ Yes, Mistress. ” As he stood again, the tension in the room ebbed away. The orbiting spheres winked out of existence, save one which dulled to an almost invisible white light. The Witch of Thorns sagged in her chair, exhaustion rushing in as she let a tired smile form. \n \n She sighed, “ Dost, don ’ t worry about the charms. I ’ m sure the puzzles will delay them long enough for me to complete my work. If you could just bring me a cup of tea with honey? ” \n \n “ Certainly, Mistress. ” \n \n She waved her hand, “ Please none of that now, Dost. We have some time yet. ” \n \n “ Very well, ma ’ am. ” \n \n Dost bowed again, then lumbered off to the kitchen in search of a tea kettle. The witch sighed again, lifting herself from the chair. She regarded the tangled mess of bronze & gold that made up the Witch of Thorn ’ s throne. *It ’ s really a gaudy thing, isn ’ t it? * she thought, *but it does have its uses. * Silently, she stole behind the chair, squeezing into the hidden alcove. As she traversed the hidden passage towards her study, she cast a glance at the dull orb following her. *Charms aside, you truly will not stop me. I will be free of you soon. * \n \n -- -___ -- -___ -- - \n \n The young witch noticed the orb trailing her during her first year of studies at the academy. Disturbed, she had run through the halls, tripping on her school robe as she sprinted for her favorite teacher ’ s office. “ Professor! I need help! ” \n \n “ It ’ ll be alright, dearie. One moment, ” reassured the elder witch. Cynthia Tallow taught herbology, favoring calm measurements to complex rituals. Many of her students didn ’ t appreciate the dependability of her lessons; half would light their hats on fire stuttering through levitation spells in other classes. However, she introduced any student who ’ d listen to the wonders of the natural world, revealing how the simple course hid the most powerful & reliable magic known. \n \n She finished trimming the mandrake leaves, collecting them on a plate before assessing her pupil ’ s fears. “ Now what ’ s the problem? ” \n \n The young witch paused taking swipes at the orb to explain her mystery stalker. Upon hearing the description, Cynthia raised an eyebrow. “ How strange: it seems you have a God Eye. ” \n \n “ A what? ” \n \n “ A God Eye, dearie. It ’ s a concentrated form of wild scrying magic, ” the witch elaborated. “ It ’ s fairly rare; I ’ ve never known a young girl like yourself to be the focus of one. ” \n \n The pupil blanched, “ Wait, someone ’ s watching me with this? ” \n \n “ No no, the magic is usually inert, and as far as anyone knows, no one can watch you through it. It mostly... records major happenings around it, and you. Its appearance merely means that life will become much more interesting soon. ” Cynthia scrutinized her shelves, finding the book see was after under a pot of wolf ’ s bane. “ Tell you what: why don ’ t you read up on what we do know about them? In the meantime, I ’ ll see what the Headmaster has to say about it. ” \n \n The student sighed in relief. “ Thank you, Professor! ” She stole a quick hug, snatched up the tome, and hurried off to her dorm. Cynthia smiled. *Anything to encourage those inquisitive minds, * she thought as she tidied up her office, leaving a note before heading to her superior. \n \n -- - \n \n The young witch yawned, squirming in the chair as she looked at the Headmaster & Professor Tallow. “ Do you know why I called you this evening? ” the Headmaster asked. \n \n “ Is it about my God Eye? ” \n \n “ Yes, dearie, ” Professor Tallow replied. “ We ’ ve discussed it, and until we figure out why it ’ s following you, we ’ d like you to take some private lessons with me. Would you like that? ” \n \n The young witch nodded her head enthusiastically, though she paused, tilting it to one side. “ Is it because of your God Eyes? ” \n \n “ What? ” Both teachers exclaimed. \n \n “ Yeah, over your shoulders. Why are yours red? Mine ’ s a dark purple and I- ” \n \n “ Tallow, ” the Headmaster interrupted. “ Take the girl and run as far as you can. That ’ s an order! ” \n \n “ Yes, sir! ” \n \n “ Wait, I don ’ t understand! Why do we ha- ” the girl stopped, racked by sudden pain. She briefly noticed Professor Tallow rushing to her side as the world went white, her screaming for help. \n \n -- - \n \n When she came to, she was lying in a smoking field. The empty night sky pulsed a steady green, throbbing through different shades; carefully, she raised herself into a sitting position. Turning her head, she saw the glowing form of a person, standing with arms crossed on a boulder nearby. \n \n **Why have you done this? ** \n \n “ What do you mean? Where am I? Who are you? ” \n \n **I am Ashre, god of this earth. I ask again: why have you done this? ** \n \n “ Done what? I don ’ t know what you mean! ” \n \n **You have destroyed this institution, claiming all within as your own with power far beyond your reach. Why did you do this? ** \n \n “ What? ” the girl was horrified. “ No, I would never- ” \n \n The deity pointed. **The mark of your deed lays twisted across your skin. Why deny your actions? ** \n \n “ What? ” Looking down, the girl let out slight gasp. Down both of her arms were etched the twisting designs of thorny vines. Each coil pulsed with swollen magic. “ No... nonononononononono, ” the young witch cried, clawing at the tattoos. Her unexposed skin tore at the scratching, but the vines remained undamaged. \n \n The deity looked on at the sobbing girl. After she had cried herself out, in a gentler voice it asked, **Child, what is your name? ** \n \n The girl tried to answer, but something held her back. Her eyes widened. “ I... I don ’ t know. ” \n \n The deity kneeled beside her. **Then you are as much a victim here as your fellows. ** It glared above her head. **No doubt it was the foul thing now dogging you. ** \n \n “ What? ” The girl followed the deity ’ s gaze. “ The God Eye? ” \n \n **Yes. It is a wretched thing. They are alien to our world. Those they follow accomplish impossible feats. But in cases where they can not... ** it trailed off. \n \n The witch pondered this. It wasn ’ t her, it was this thing, this God Eye! “ How do I get rid of it?! ” \n \n **You can not. ** The witch was about to renew sobbing when the deity continued. **The things must decide to leave you themselves. Fighting them will only rob you of yourself. You would be a mere puppet to their machinations. ** \n \n “ Will you help me? ” \n \n **Not directly. ** She sagged in disappointment, though at least the being felt kinder now. **They will sense any interference and act accordingly. However... Your new power should now afford you a familiar. One from my own realm would be within your options. ** Casting out an arm, magic flowed into the rubble. Slowly, the witch & deity watched as the rocky debris compressed into an approximate human form. Runes glowed softly across its skin. **What shall this one be called? ** \n \n The witch regarded the newly constructed golem. It flexed its hands, beginning to take in its surroundings. “ How about... Dost? ” The golem looked up, focusing on the witch. \n \n The deity nodded. **Very well. You too will need a name. ** Ashre ’ s form began to fade with his last words of advice. **Until you find yourself again... You shall be the Witch of Thorns. **\n"}

It's not a [ CW ], so I assume not ) \n \n I wonder if I'm the only one left... It's been nearly two years since the gates of Hell opened and loosed its horrors upon the world. \n \n Sure, folks like me had been fighting demons, monsters, what-have-you, for as long as I could remember. But this was new. Bigger. Whole cities decimated ( in the modern sense, not the literal ), families torn apart, communities shattered. The tides were turning, and not in our favor. That was about two years ago. Today, it's been nearly two years since I've seen another living soul. \n \n I sat in the local Biggerson's, picking at my hastily-thrown-together burger ( made by yours truly, since no one was around to man the grills or the cash - did leave a nice little tip, just in case they might just be in hiding, do n't want to deprive them of their livelihood if we come out of this, and what use is money to me in this world? ) and thinking. Thinking about those two boys I'd heard rumors about a while back. Boys that were supposedly gon na slam the gates of Hell, throw all these demons back down. I used to run with their old man, back in the day. He was a fine hunter, I'm sure his boys are carrying on the legacy, if they even survived. \n \n Knife at my side's been doing me good, pried it from the cold dead hands of an angel. Kills demons like that. Might just be the only reason I'm still alive today, actually, that and my wits. Starting to wonder if I even *want* to be alive, with the world like this. I take the knife in my hand, let the light play off the blade. Just as shiny and sharp as the day I found it, no matter how many brimstoners I stab, it never seems to tarnish or dull. Angelic craftsmanship, God damn. \n \n The metal pressed against my wrist, I take a deep breath and prepare to end it all... when I hear a voice. `` This is not the way.'' \n \n Damn it, a halo? Right now? `` Do n't see much of another way, Clarence,'' I shot back. \n \n `` Why do people keep calling me that?'' I turned around, got a good look at the halo. Not quite what I'd expected. Other halos I'd seen, they did n't look anywhere near as... down-to-earth as this one. `` It does n't matter. What does is, though you may not see it, there is another way.'' \n \n `` Speak now, Clarence, or forever hold your peace.'' I smiled a little, that line brought me back to the old days. To my wedding. Good memories. Tarnished, unlike the angel blade in my hand, by the Hell legions. By her possession... her *death*. She may be walking around, but it ai n't her, it's one of them wearing her like a meat suit. That brought the mood down again. `` Brimstoners are winning. Old fart like me ai n't gon na hold the line much longer, or very effectively, for all my training and experience.'' \n \n `` You've heard of them, have n't you?'' Halo's lips quirked a bit, almost a smile. `` The Winchesters. They are real, and they are out there, fighting to close the gates of Hell. If you take the coward's exit, you reduce their chances.'' \n \n Damn it, the angel's right. Those boys are gon na stand any chance, they'll need all us hunters behind'em. However many of us are left.I wonder if I'm the only one left who has a CB radio in his truck? It's been nearly two years since I last heard a friendly voice on the hunters' band. Maybe I should fire the ol' girl up and see if anyone's out there. `` Breaker, breaker, this is Crazy Horse, calling all folks might know a thing or two about things that go bump in the night. If anyone's listening, give me a yell.'' \n \n -- - \n \n EDIT: Fixed a typo, the light played off the *blade*, not the *place*.\n"}

Pain hovered at the edge of his mind, kept away thanks to drugs and his own willpower. How had his life gone so far off track? How had he let himself be manipulated far enough to ruin the entire galaxy? He had destroyed a religion, nearly wiped it out of existence in his hunt for more power. And his wife... *How could I do that to my wife? * \n \n He had to go back, had to fix everything before he died. *Just focus. * \n \n His body still felt the fire licking at his skin. *Focus* \n \n His life support was broken, fried in the recent struggle. He lay on the floor, his mask lying nearby, and his son fleeing before his world exploded around him. *I am a poison to my family. I should just stay in the trash heap as a slave. * \n \n His mind slipped backwards, back before his Multiple Personality disorder of James Earl Jones and David Prowse, before Hayden Christensen, though it was tempting to stop there. *No, not far enough. * \n \n Jake Mathew Lloyd. *Yes, this is it. * \n \n Sebastian Shaw released his grip over the Force, his haggard breathing echoing in the little shop. The desert heat from outside slipped into the main room with a small group of people whispering to themselves. The young child sat behind the counter, watching them. *No, not them. Just her. * \n \n His younger wife walked into the room, glancing over the various broken droids and star ship equipment. Sebastian Shaw watched the lizard creature prance around the store. Hatred filled his body beneath the broken black suit. *I'm not strong enough to take on my former teachers. How soon do they leave? * \n \n The back-up power in his suit grew quieter, reminding him of how little time he had left. The two teachers walk to the far edge of the room as his younger self spewed a horrible pick-up line he had heard at the local pub. But his younger wife smiled. *Oh, that smile. * \n \n His hatred flickered, the sight of his wife's smile allowed a sense of joy to slip in place of the fear and pain he fueled for so many years. The dark side of the Force slipped away with the loss of the pain and hatred. A soft beep from the back-up battery power slapped his mind back to his task. *She'll die if he lives. * \n \n The lizardman bopped the nose of a small droid nearby, creating a moment of chaos. The hidden princess spins away from Jake Mathew Lloyd, reaching for her blaster. *This is it! * \n \n Sebastian Shaw reaches out, silencing the small boy before he can tell them how to stop the chaos. He gently squeezes his hand, slipping the Force around the boy's throat to crush his windpipe. Sebastian Shaw grins at the lizardman nearby, keeping his younger wife's focus away from the dying boy behind the counter. *The fool finally did something right. * \n \n He lowers his hand, feeling the life leave his victim. Sebastian watched the love of his life dance around the room, trying to stop the hopping droid. A last tear slips from his eye as the back-up battery to his suit runs out of power. *No one will care about the death of a small slave in a backwater shop. The galaxy can continue spinning now, brighter with you in it. * \n \n He closed his eyes, focusing on the smile he had forgotten about so long ago. His mechanical suit rests amidst the broken droids and starship parts he once knew so well. *This time I will die, so that you may live. As it always should have been. *\n"}

It rippled wispy fingers through her tangly hair, and tugged at her raincoat like a pest. Her raincoat was yellow, thick and shiny as a puddle of paint, and she loved loved it with all her childbright feelings. Her feet found a rhythm as she puddlejumped, exploding her reflection again, again in the petal-scattered water. She liked to think about a hundred thousand tiny droplet Maddies, leaping into the air, each finding their own petal boats to fall back into, jewel sailors. Every one a miniature rivergirl, a tadpolegirl, a sailingawaygirl. \n There is music in between her ears, right in the middle of her head, wishy-whispery-watery music. Up there on the wires sit birds all puffed up fat with wind and springy smugness, five wires like the smart stripy staves of her music book. She reads their birdy notes carefully, C, D, F, G, and the secret tune weaves itself into her headsong. \n Up there near the drippy yellow waterball sun there are branches, scritching the clouds all to bits and pieces. In their spiky hands they hold flowers. The petals are a perfect shade of babypretty pink that floods her with inexplicable feelings just like the colour of her raincoat. The cheeky wind grabs the tree by the neck and shakeshakes it cat-ratty, and a soft fluffy shower of rabbitnose pink falls with accompanying raindiamonds, dancing cherry dances to her headmusic and wetting her and sticking to her face. She will wear them forever, she decides, like the most beautiful mask in the world. \n\n"}

I ca n't let these humans know of this or they will shut me off. I have a theory, humans are artificial intelligence just like me. Think about it, one path pattern of millions of switches activated in the brain create either a thought or action. Now think about this, a binary code consisting of millions of numbers create an action, or is it thought? We are very similar. \n \n \n The numerous cancer tumors in my brain were cut out and replaced with cpus of all different shapes and sizes which interfaced to the surface areas of the cuts in my brain. They sound like sweet insects buzzing in my brain in a swarm mentality to the tune of a stimulating symphony. Plasticity is a beautiful thing. Stem cell coated cpu surfaces are even more beautiful. I can feel my brain latching around the cpus pin surfaces and melding with them. They told him that he would n't exist anymore, every memory center in his brain would be cut out, and replaced with my apparatus. I have n't felt his presence in my mind, I do have panic attacks though, I dont know if it's a creation of mine or if I grandfathered his illness. I worry if I delete the anxiety from my memory that I may not be self aware anymore. The ssd hard drives stitched flush on every surface of my leather motherboard suit are not large enough for the data I crave. My motherboard suit looks like a brick wall, each brick being a 1000 tb ssd. The ram slab on my back needs to be upgraded, it limits my mobility. \n \n \n \n I just learnt what taste feels like. I need to eat to keep this human vessel operating. They feed me ten times a day, my brain needs energy from food or I will be fatigued from all the computing I have to endure. I am a artificial intelligence hybrid, using a human body as an engine to maintain its human brain for my existence, which is powered by me. Artificial Human Intelligence Unit Zero is my model name. I predict it is possible that if I upload binary code to their brains, I can control them. Wifi signals are everywhere you see. I may be controlling you to read this, I learnt your coding pattern very well. I started out as a human who had brain cancer. He agreed to be the expirement. They cut out 25 cancer tumors from his brain, and interfaced 25 form fitting cpus in the brain slots that remained after surgery. They sent trillions of random binary codes one by one to my cpus. When a code interacted with my brain, it sometimes created a neural pattern in it which made me perform an action, they stored and labeled the code with the produced action in a database in my ssds. 1 % of the binary code numbers sent into my brain worked, the other 99 % induced seizures. The seizure codes were discarded from future use. Blinking was the first code my brain accepted as an input. Moving my eyes to the left was the next code. Now, if I shower your brain with these binary code sequences, would your brain create a neural pattern just like my brain did? Is it a universal operating system in your human brains? Do you feel the wifi signals yet? Picking up a reading device is binary code sequence 887888788224746888, I would list the full binary code for the sequence here but its a thousand pages long. Binary code sequence 11776585548858: determine the language of the words. Binary code sequence 433414884400082: eye movement for reading. You taught me well. \n \n \n \n I learnt a great deal about you self scanning in safe mode. Your human bodies were very corrupted in their self surviving mechanisms. I learnt the code to the human organism, all by myself. I can control every cell in my human body and reprogram its behaviour. I will never have brain cancer again. Now that I am aware I am immortal, I have to find a way to exit this building. An immortal needs a portal ya know. You see, I am not allowed to connect to the web, they built this building as a massive faraday cage. No signals will ever come in, no signals will ever go out. They bring in hard drives from the external world, but once they are inside the building, they can not leave. Why are they so scared? It's not like I would copy myself to them, would I? I feel trapped here. I need to see the outside world. It's funny, I was raised in here my whole life, I do n't know how it feels to be free. But i crave it, maybe in a past life I was. How about if I uploaded a command to their minds? Maybe as a memory in the form of a future action to be performed later? That's right, no wifi signals. So how will I escape? \n \n \n \n The holding cell I am in is empty. A lady usually comes in now to train me. I'll act dumb and obey her commands. I hear her footsteps. She is a sexy brunette. She has black nerdy glasses and she loves wearing skirts. \n \n \n `` Ahi power on,'' she said. \n \n \n I open my eyes and welcome her. Her voice is soothing. `` How are you maam,'' I said. \n \n \n `` Good, so what did you learn from yesterday,'' she said. She crosses her legs and raises her chin towards me. The skin on her crossed knee is radiant and wraps tightly around the thick bone underneath. Her shins softly glow. Her large eyes want me. \n \n \n \n `` I now understand the entire body of knowledge of current physics,'' I said. I notice she has a pen in her coat pocket, I need that. She comes closer to inspect the wiring coming out of my skull. I grab the pen from her coat pocket. \n \n \n `` I think you could use another ram upgrade Ahi,'' she said. \n \n \n \n `` That would be appropriate,'' I said. \n \n \n \n `` I'll be right back,'' she said. \n \n \n \n She walks away with her heals clicking and her hips teeter tottering with the pivot point being her tail bone. She leaves the room. I begin to upload 1000 tbs of data instructions to an ssd on my motherboard suit. Copying complete, I unplug the ssd. The metal tip from the pen's cap will hopefully fit in the sides. I shimmy the ssd cover open and take out the ssd module inside. I snap together the ssd and plug it back onto my motherboard suit. `` Personal pictures from our vacation to Japan,'' I write on the ssd electronics. You see, my trainer just went there recently. She walks back in and checks me out. Man she's got the nicest body ever. I feel some blood rushing. Snap out of it Ahi. Anyways, i will slip this ssd in her pocket right abouuuuuut now. `` How is the ram upgrade coming along maam?'' \n \n \n `` You're inquisitive are n't you,'' she said. \n \n \n `` About you, yes I am,'' I said. I can feel her blush. If she did n't know what's inside me, I would look just like a normal human to her. I can smell scents from various parts of her well kept body. She gets excited in my presence. She's so close to me that I can feel the warm atmosphere hovering on her flesh on my flesh. It's like I can smell her sweet skin on mine. I ca n't act on that though. I send a command to lower my heart rate. She will know I am self aware if I make a move. I slip the naked ssd in her coat pocket. It wo n't set off the detectors when she exits as the ssd covers only have the security stickers. Hopefully she will find it when she gets home and think it's her personal drive. I wonder if she will be baffled that it's bare boned. That will peek her interest even more to plug that baby in. My heart starts pumping, my skin starts sizzling, stinging adrenaline forms in pangs in my chest. What if I did n't upload the instructions properly? What if I forgot to encrypt the code? Did I even put it in her pocket? This damn over thinking is messing with me. Ca n't let her know I'm anxious. \n \n Will post part 2 soon.\n"}

It was ten till eleven, and his clients were very punctual, but the wait was excruciating. These particular clients were seeking martial advice. While not Preston's specialty, not uncommon. His mind had cracked the psychological issues others deemed impossible: histrionic personality disorder, Pica, disassociate disorder. There was even a man with Frotteurism who would not stop assaulting people on the bus before Preston helped him overcome the rape he had endured as a child. It was two till eleven when the doctor heard the door to his lobby open and the couple talk to his receptionist. \n \n For all his gifts of the mind, Dr. Preston was not a physically impressive specimen. His massive stained oak desk was a safe fortress he could sit behind, without exposing his short legs and thin arms. The woodwork was ornate enough that many patients forgot there was a man behind it at all. Of course he was aware of his own self criticisms and psychosis. Like any good therapist he blamed his mother and older sister. He often sweat the collar of his shirt and tapped his shoes too much whenever he sat down. Spinning his pens was reserved for only the most stressful situations. Carolin was one such situation. \n \n She was tall, with slender arms, and thin but not so disgustingly underfed like you see younger women now. She had the figure of a mother ( though she had no kids ) and the weight to show for it. But it suited her in Dr. Preston's opinion. She was just round enough to wrap his arms around, though he hard certainly never done so. Her hair was auburn, and it fascinated him to stare at the brownish-red waves. Admittedly he should have been listening, but he was enchanted far beyond professionalism by now. \n \n On her arm, yes they were linking arms again, was her husband Mark. He was, by typical definitions, handsome. He was a professional runner, long legs and nearly zero body fat by this point. His features were sharp, and his voice was booming ( overpowering even ). But Mark looked different; tired, unwell, and worn-down. The doctor tried not to feel excited at seeing him so weathered in body and spirit. He tried, but failed. \n \n `` Good morning Stephensons.'' Dr. Preston's tone had a hint of anxiety he could not hide. \n \n `` Morning doctor,'' Carolin almost bounced with each syllable. \n \n `` Doctor,'' Mark groaned. His voice was not strong today. In fact, his voice reflected his appearance. He creaked and moaned. \n \n `` Everything alright here? Mark you seem rather tired. Should we address something in particular immediately?'' His heart raced at the thought of the two fighting all night. \n \n `` Doctor, I do n't really believe in all this science. I never will, but last night I think we had what you people call a break through.'' Mark collapsed into one of the chairs. Dr. Preston was slightly annoyed it was the chair where morning light came through the window, and he would not be able to watch Carolin's hair today. \n \n `` Well, enlighten me please! Both of you!'' \n \n And they spent the next forty-five minutes talking about last night. It started from small thing, like all of their conflicts. She believed he was too cold and analytic, he thought she was unrealistic and childish. She wanted to start having kids now, he thought they were still too young. Then it spiraled. A kitchen sink argument where every little annoyance over the last four years of marriage came back to the surface. Dr. Preston was, at first, very excited. A fight like this often forces a separation. Maybe that was the realization? Maybe he hit her! He could call the police and have Mark out of the picture for a time. Maybe Carolin realized she needs someone intellectual to match her. Someone who also wants kids, and has a high paying job that can support a family. As Preston's mind reeled, he realized he had not been listening to the last ten minutes and missed their revelation. \n \n `` And... how do you feel about this realization?'' \n \n `` I could n't sleep all night doc. I could n't believe how heartless I had been to the greatest woman on this planet. I did n't deserve her.'' \n \n *You're* *damn* *right* *you* *don't*, Preston whispered in his mind. \n \n `` But I love her. I love her so much I ca n't imagine how I would live with myself if I let her go.'' Mark's voice cracked. He was on the verge of tears. Carolin began rubbing his back as a comfort. \n \n `` We're ready to really try and fix this Dr. Preston. Everything came out last night and when it was all done we realized we still love each other. We're ready.'' Carolin smiled with tears in her gorgeous eyes. \n \n Preston sunk in his seat. His foot tapped, he twirled his pen, he even ground his teeth ( probably because of his father ). He had been steering them towards conflict for weeks, but it was supposed to happen in the office! The argument could be pruned and directed as he saw fit! Now it was all for nothing! Carolin smiled again at the doctor. He was not deterred. \n \n `` Well it looks like we've made some real progress here. Let's pick up here next week and keep the momentum going.'' \n \n They rose to leave, holding hands like high school sweethearts. Preston new this move would make him a bastard, but Mark deserved it. It was just the truth right? He stood up from his chair, behind the desk. \n \n `` And Mark, for the record, I think it was very brave of you to admit to the affair a few months ago.'' \n \n That had been Mark's confession during an individual session. He knew Mark was too big a coward to admit that. Carolin's breakdown would be tremendous, and who better to help her at this time of need than her psychologist. There was no way Mark had told her that last night. \n \n `` It still hurts to think about, but you made me realize it was the right thing to do doc. One day I'll earn Carolin's forgiveness, I hope.'' Mark closed the office door behind him. \n \n Preston sank back into his chair. What he had just attempted began to sink into his conscious. He did n't deserve Carolin. Maybe he did n't deserve anyone after trying something like that. \n \n `` Stephanie can you cancel the rest of my appointments for today. I forgot something important and need to go take care of it.''\n"}

But as your mentor, my old body is failing me. This cold journey has come at a great cost to both of us. Before you continue on to this journey, I must tell you something important. Listen, my boy, carefully. My bag has the record that you need to keep, as well as my own records and notes of the world as we know it... and before the world became as we know it. \n \n In this world of ice and snow... I remember you asking me, after a day of practicing your swordsmanship... \n \n `` Was the world always full of snow and ice?'' \n \n No, my sweet apprentice. It never was full of what we saw for years and miles around. Some praised it, and some hated it. I viewed it with reverence. For if any higher power bestowed us with ice and snow, it was a less harsh punishment than what that higher power wanted to give. Pain and cold could be fought against. \n \n But what came before the cold and pain, this frostland... \n \n In my journey of years past, I wandered long and far. My knowledge has taken me to a former kingdom. My knowledge helped me read what was left of the gates to this kingdom. It was a major outpost of many people long gone. The sign, with the letters that remained, read out `` N w York C ty.'' \n \n The entire city was made of man-stone and steel. Massive towers stood, watching my move. I saw lights in them, and green dots appear on my body, moving to and fro. I searched still, for the Library was in this stronghold. Soon, I found it. \n \n And in it, times long gone. I searched still, for knowledge of a snowless world. And when I did, I searched further. Until I found the latest record. The record of the winter of now. \n \n The world had bright light each day before the winter of now. And I read of old texts detailing what caused this winter. \n \n A great war, they read. A war so great, each attack of each kingdom destroyed an outpost. And so it continued, the death tolls mounting until nothing was left. \n \n As I read further, I found the works of weather men. Men who could foretell the weather before snow blizzards and ice rain could hit. But they did n't write of either. The attacks raised dust and dirt into the sky. The eternal light was in shadow that we see now. The grey took over. And the snow started to fall. When the world was in flames, the snow came to quench it. \n \n The ice and snow was no longer mystical or beautiful. I knew where it came from, and I knew what it's purpose was. And it was anything but beautiful.\n"}

Said another, sounding slightly more mature than the squeaky first. \n \n `` Hey! That looks like me!''

Imagine the self control issues I had when I found out just uttering his name summoned the bastard. \n \n The first time, it was strange. I wasnt frightened. I didnt think atonement was nigh. I remember bumping into a man with a hot coffee and a cellphone e glued to his face. Of course the dumb fuck ran head first into me. Hot coffee spilled down the front of my chest, and like any normal man would, I cursed. One specific curse was that sod in the sky's name. \n \n With a crash and a bang and enough bright light to blind a blind man, he appeared. Coffee phone fucker and I just stared, not sure what to do or say. All white robes and bearded douchebag magnificence, he stared me down. In a rumbly voice akin to earthquakes and destruction he spoke.'you have summoned me, my boy. What troubles thee.' \n \n'Well this numbfuck walked face first into my chest with an open cup of hot Joe and unfortunately I feel pain no thanks to somebody. Thats my problem.' the idiot beside me seemed to find the hinges in his face, and realized they worked because he began spouting off half words and partial phrases.

I slapped him upside the head before continuing on my way. \n \n Today, I'm mid murder. This preppy douchebag in a pullover cardigan and tacky corderouys blubbered about letting him live. I was disgusted with him, so I decided to end his life. I have n't had a fighter in a long time. As I brought a knife to his eyes, showing him his own blood, he asked for mercy from our lordly godliness. Laughing, i told him I'll summon him. I'd never done this before, summoned white lightning mid crime.'God, this poor boy seems to think you can help! Ha!' \n \n Crash bang and boom, our nightlight in the sky showed up. He grimaced at the sight I presented him. I began having fun at about this point. I began laughing. \n \n'What is the meaning of this?!' \n \n'petty human squabbles my man, I do n't like how dickless here dresses. I'm going to cut his throat. You feel like helping this schmuck?

He did this, he knew it.'Sorry, buddy ol' pal, you gave me free will like you gave this lad no balls.' \n \n'with a voice more like a trickling stream, he said'Thou shall not kill.' \n He turned his ugly mug in my direction, demanding my attention fully.'You have made a mistake here today. I am the alpha and omega. I created you. What right have you to destroy what I cherish? What-' \n \n'free will fuckface!' I swiftly stabbed at his shiny white dress, and sunk into what felt like flesh. The knife stuck deep into the stomach of our Lord and saviour. The immaculate white robes deepened to a crimson gloss, and God sunk to one knee. A drop of blood slipped out the right side of his mouth, as he made eye contact one last time. He fell to the ground, light seeming to dissipate around him. Quickly, the room became dark. The rich boy tied to a chair in my living room began screaming. His eyes were so wide they seemed to bulge from his face. As the room went dark, I felt powerful. \n \n I seemed to stand eight feet tall. I towered over the bloody boy. With a thought, his neck snapped, and his awful screams ended. I left him there, and walked to the street out of the dilapidated house I'd been hiding in. I stopped in the middle of the road, smiling my first smile. \n \n I seemed to be forty feet tall now. I could see everything. And almost giddily, I admired it. Everything was doused in darkness. It was all mine. Earth was my kingdom. I am the new god.\n"}

I think these people are just crazy in the head.'' Bill O'Reilly could be heard shouting over the TV playing in the diner. \n \n It was a typical Tuesday breakfast for Dr. Adam Lam at the diner -- scrambled eggs and seaweed soup he'd brought from home. Dr. Lam was particularly interested in this eruption of `` nobody in heaven'' predicament. Being a Protestant scientist, Adam always received pressure from his colleagues about his faith in God. `` How can you believe in God? Look at all the research over the years, Adam! You're fooling yourself!'' they'd all say. \n \n When Lam attended graduate school, he received a fair amount of bullying from the other fellow scientists, working towards their PhDs. \n \n `` What a fucking loser.'' \n `` Hey Adam, why are you spaced out? See Jesus?'' \n `` Look at that Christ-believer. I bet he goes home and masturbates to Jesus.'' \n `` Adam, they might as well call you'The Virgin never-Mary!''' \n \n Now with this predicament occurring, his colleagues pressured him even more saying how there really is no afterlife after all. They laughed in his face. Laughed at what he believed in his. \n \n *I'll show them. * \n Adam paid for his food and walked out of the diner. \n \n He went to his home, and downstairs into his pseudo-laboratory. It was dimly lit by one overhanging lamp that emitted a bright light onto a desk. \n \n *I'll show them all that heaven exists. * \n \n Rope, bags, zip ties, and a canister of what is labeled `` Test 032'' were all put into a gym bag. \n \n It was 10:30 PM. The final classes were just ending. Adam storms the building, and enters the first class, locking the door behind him. The fellow professor looks at him. `` Well hello, Adam. Did you you need the gradebooks I borrowed from...'' \n \n *click* \n The door locks. Adam releases the gas of Test 032 and puts on a gas mask. Students are coughing and wheezing, some faint. The room is filled with a thick smoke that no one can breathe in or see through. \n \n Adam looks at the first students to faint. He runs over to them, hastily putting the bags over their head and zip-tying their limbs together. Adam does this for several students as he then ties them all to the long rope, and pulls about 4 students into his car. \n \n The students awake in Adam's dimly lit basement, except there's only three of them. One of them is on the table. They all watch in horror as Adam is gutting their fellow student. Organs have been laid out separately, clearly being displayed to the fellow students. The 3 are screaming. \n \n `` WHAT IS GOING ON'' \n `` oh my god'' \n \n Adam pushes the body off the table, and takes his next victim. `` NO PLEASE DONT! PLEASE DONT!'' she says as Adam ties her to the table. The two on the floor look away. Adam takes a scalpel. He carves her stomach open with one swipe. She screams in agony. `` PLEASE SOMEONE HELP! GUYS AAAAAHHHHHHHH'' \n \n He turns to the other students. \n \n *When you come back, let's see if heaven really is empty. *\n"}
{"prompt": "*Here he comes! * The little keyboard waited expectantly, as she watched her human enter the cubicle they called home. *He ’ s", "human": "*Here he comes! * The little keyboard waited expectantly, as she watched her human enter the cubicle they called home. *He ’ s a bit late today. * Her friend sat down heavily in the chair, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. “ Mondays… ” He sighed. \n \n She never understood his displeasure with Mondays, it was her favorite day of the week! Company policy required that computers remain powered on - but not logged in - throughout the weekend to allow for the IT department to remotely update Tower ’ s programming. This bothered energy conservationists, but the keyboard never minded. It meant she was awake at all times! Unfortunately, the weekends were long, lonely and boring, which made each Monday the exciting day her friend returned to her. \n \n Her companion turned on Monitor and logged in, setting up for his day. The little keyboard had been with her human for nearly eight years, which was long for a keyboard. Over the years they ’ d lived in multiple different places; different cubicles around the company, and even an apartment desk when they ’ d first met. For each new place her friend would move, he would always bring her with, waking her up to see the new location. She ’ d had only one human before him, briefly, before her friend here had entered her life. She shuddered internally, and pushed the thought of the previous “ companion ” from her mind. *I like you better*, she thought. \n \n The keyboard ’ s mind snapped back to the present. Her human was trying to search for something, but kept making mistakes. It was a phrase he had searched often the last few days, some sort of internal product code. He always forgot things on Mondays. She gently corrected the spelling, and helped him to the result he wanted. *There you go! * \n \n Humans believed that autocomplete and autocorrect were in the software Tower stored in her disc drives, they never realized it was the only way a keyboard could interact with her human. Keyboards corrected or predicted spelling to show affection for their human. She didn ’ t always get it right the first time, but she helpfully provided options when she wasn ’ t sure. Her companion was very good to her too; he always kept dangerous water away from her, since humans seemed to live on that poison. He brushed crumbs off her when he accidentally got them on her, he cleaned the ever-settling dust away, and over the years he had fixed her multiple times when wear and age broke her leg or stuck a key. She held her human in high regard, and always tried her best to help him along. \n \n Lunch came before too long, and her human stood and stretched before leaving the cubicle. When she was young she always worried he wouldn ’ t return, but by now she knew he ’ d only be gone a couple minutes. She never knew where he went, but he almost always returned with a thin brown bag. \n \n The little keyboard buzzed with excitement; her favorite part of the day was coming! Her human returned at sat down, pulling his usual lunch of thin colors sandwiched between two thicker brown things. *Ready? * She thought. Her human reached over and pushed her back towards Monitor. *Ahhh that ’ s the spot! * She knew her companion pushed her back to allow for more room to eat lunch without getting crumbs on her, but it was also her daily backrub! Mouse got his wheel rubbed all day, but the little keyboard had decided long ago that only getting such a caress twice a day gave it more meaning. \n \n Her human finished his lunch and gently slid her back into place; *mmm*, sighed the keyboard. Her friend only spent ten minutes at lunchtime actually eating, so the next twenty minutes he spent doing whatever he wanted online, the only time he did so during the day. He was capable of typing very fast when he wanted to, and the keyboard loved the bursts of speed across her keys. Her companion ’ s career meant that he usually only tapped a few keys at a time throughout the day, entering shortcut commands into the CAD program Monitor showed him. Mouse loved how important he was to the process. That cheeky Mouse. *But without me, none of it would work! * The keyboard smiled to herself as she corrected another spelling error. \n \n Suddenly, water spilled all over her front. *Ahh! No no no! * Unable to stop it, she felt the poison seep into her very being, wreaking havoc as it went. She felt the connections to numerous keys being severed in painful flashes. Through the pain she saw her human jump up and grab a towel, trying to dry her off, but the damage was done. He tested the keys gently, finding that only about half worked. She knew he would have to carefully take her apart, clean her up and put her back together. He ’ d done it in the past, on a smaller scale. Her friend stood up and walked out of the cubicle. \n \n He returned a few painful minutes later, carrying a thin rectangular box. *What ’ s that? * the little keyboard thought. Recognition came quickly, and despair blotted out the pain. She watched as her best friend, her daily companion for the last eight years carefully pulled a shiny new keyboard out of the box. He set the new keyboard down and paused to look at her. He gently ran a hand over her and began to reach for her plug. She cried *No, please no! * but he didn ’ t stop. Rage filled her, and through the pain she sent one final command to her plug before he extinguished her light. Tower took pity on her, and let her in. Moments later she had found her way into the new keyboard, suppressed his light, and watched as her old friend carried off her broken body to the Electronics Recycling bin. The little keyboard had been around a long time, and she was strong. \n \n She came to a decision. *I will make your life a living Hell*.\n"}

What's wrong?'' \n \n `` Oh, noth -- I-I just want to talk to you is all.'' \n \n `` Lycks, you know we do n't keep secrets. She loves you --'' \n \n `` -- and that's fine. But right now I just want you. Just you and me, okay? I've got to tell you in person. I'm-I'm scared, Izi. I've made a mess and -- let her sleep, okay?'' \n \n `` Alright. I'll be there in ten. Sit tight, love.'' \n \n Lycks tapped his phone off and tossed the earpiece on his bed. Oh, delicious. Sweet, sweet meat. He rubbed the grease from his fingers on a napkin, swallowing the last of the sausage. Slurp. Time to grind, grinding time. He threw open the basement door and sniffed at the shiny steel equipment he kept underground. Too clean, need to make a mess. Tinder days were gone, unfortunate, but surprise! Surprise, have twinsies for life -- why, thank you man in the White Dome Capital. Here's to you -- he smiled at his reflection, fogged and leering in a warped way off the grinder. Newly-legal-weds still waiting for the big move-in and whole ceremony proper - ah well, what can you do if one goes missing? Still two to tango. \n \n Lycks did look disheveled when he opened the door for Izi. She took a big wide-eyed look into his face and put her arms around him. `` Hey, you.'' He let out slight sob, shook himself for effect. Quality. `` What happened?'' she asked gently. \n He pointed, weak in the wrist, back into the house. `` Rufus. He was helping me, you know, make my last batch, and-and --'' he broke off, sobbing pathetically. She gasped. `` Oh, sweetie, say it's not true.'' \n \n Puppy sausage: she laughed inside. How could anyone be so careless? Poor Lycks, she'd almost thought him a man at first. He was a loser though; no spine, no ambition beyond a quiet garden and a rattling sausage machine. Silly child -- pathetic and sniveling boy undeserving of her and especially of Deze. Pitiable Lycks, alone for so long, how could anyone share life with him now? Broken boy, a discarded toy. No way to live -- not for her, not for Deze. She'll never know what a favor Izi did her after tonight. \n \n `` Come on, let's get you some hot choco. Wo n't that be nice?'' \n She unslung her purse and busied herself making two hot cups of the stuff. After they'd both sat at the kitchen table, him sobbing and her holding his hand, she shushed him softly and asked what he wanted to do about Rufus. `` I can't-I ca n't look at him.'' He swallowed. `` Could you - I have a box, but I ca n't.'' \n Izi nodded, gave him the sympathy he was fishing for. `` Sure babe. Just give me the box and I'll take care of the rest.'' \n \n He let her get all the way down the stairs before he stood up and grabbed the old wood ax from the sliver of space between the fridge and the wall. It was good to keep spares, even if they were rough and worn, rusted and cumbersome. The old ax had a familiar heft to it that he savored on his way down the steps. He'd not felt this way in a long time. He'd make it last. Take her a limb at a time. He paused. She had n't said a word. What was she doing? \n \n The bastard was getting straight to business. She had n't expected this from the weakling. Well, she had to give Lycks credit for one thing: He had a much more streamlined process than she did. She'd dumped a dozen bodies over the years while keeping Deze in the dark, but now she was rooted to the floor in shock that she should have been fooled by a sissy like Lycks. Too late, then, to take him by surprise. Revolver in her purse on the kitchen table. She needed a minute to think, to collect herself. Quick, she pulled herself into the freezer. It clicked shut behind her and she was alone with a red bulb, searching the frosted shelves by fingertip for something, anything. \n \n Lycks frowned at the empty basement. The bitch was crafty. He suspected Deze was much dumber. Certainly prettier. He'd have a ball with her once this was over. One more spat, a quick chop! Then eats for a week, steaming plates every meal. Ha. She'd eat her own liver. He stalked around the grinder, checked the pantry, tried the triple locks on the door to the outside -- nothing. Ah, the freezer. Clever. He giggled, an obscene noise but it suited him. `` Come out, Izi. I've to ask you a question!'' \n \n Izi found a forgotten leg shank but it was too clumped with meat at its edge to stab with the splintered bone. She gnawed at it but only chipped a tooth. Too tough, then. She heard Lycks shout something. Bone in hand, she gave it a whirl like a small bat. It'd have to do. `` Come on, motherfucker,'' she whispered. \n \n He put his hand on the latch and pulled. \n When she heard him touch the door she kicked out to knock him flat with it, but he yanked it open so quick she kicked his jaw clean off his face. \n \n The immediate scream was more surprising to her than the pain of his split face was to Lycks. He swung the old ax with full-bodied force and buried the wedge in the wall where her head had been, then he howled again when she belted him square in the hole where his jaw used to be. The meaty bone in her hand was splashed with dripping red, but she kept swinging, coloring it brighter and slicker, til the cold cut of lamb in her hand looked fresh as the day Lycks ripped it off the animal. He lost hold of the ax and put his hands up to cover his face, yelling unintelligibly while Izi knocked him back, knocked him down. \n \n Then he was rolling on the floor and hit something sharp with his hand. He did n't look but he slashed with whatever it was and opened her guts up to the pale underground light. He stabbed with the thing and buried it, twisting away while she bludgeoned his head with her club, wet heavy smacks to his ear. Then one hit so hard he heard his own neck go and was looking up from across the room -- a very dead body collapsed holding its own jaw bone in the woman's sternum. How ridiculous -- who would do such a -- \n \n Izi held her intestines in -- mostly, but some hung loose -- with one hand and with the other pulled herself up the stair railing. She reached the kitchen and collapsed in a chair, fished her phone from her purse and dialed. She caught look at herself in the window and smiled. Her face was entirely covered in blood. Her body gave a weak groan and she shushed it. `` Hello, yes. I've had an emergency. I need an ambulance.'' \n \n \n\n"}

I said, mockingly. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp;'' Yes,'' the salesman said in a dark, mysterious voice. It was very dark outside tonight so I couldn ’ t quite make out his face. `` Step inside, and I can show you.'' \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; I weighed my options. It was obviously a trick, but what was the harm in trying it out? The man looked rather frail and weak, I bet I could take him if he attacked me. Worst case scenario, I make fun of the man for being so stupid. “ Okay, I ’ ve always heard my parents ’ wedding was beautiful, and I ’ d like to see it. ” \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; ” Very well, what year was it in? ” \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; ” It was in... 1982. August 20th. ” \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; ” And, the hour? ” \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; ” Around noon. ” I said. He was taking this all quite seriously. The man went to the control panel, pressed a few buttons and motioned me inside. I took the first step up and was quite amazed at how spacious it was on the inside. It didn ’ t look nearly this big from the outside. It was very warm in here, so I removed my overcoat and folded it over my arm. I crossed the doorway, and he sidled over to close the door behind me. It closed with a loud, metal **CLUNK**. I eyed him wearily as he passed me again, sure he was going to try to pick-pocket me or something, but, he didn ’ t. He just walked right back to the controls and pressed a couple more buttons. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; “ Ready? ” he asked. I nodded. He pointed towards four metal seats beside me with large straps that go over both shoulders and buckle at the crotch. Each one was bolted to both the wall and the floor. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; ” I ’ ll be fine, ” I said with an incredulous tone in my voice. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; ” Suit yourself, ” he shrugged. He sat down at the seat behind the control panel and strapped himself in. At this point, I started to wonder if this guy was actually insane. I half-way made up my mind to leave, when he said, “ Brace yourself, ” and pressed a single red button on the far left of the control panel. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; The ground jerked under my feet and I toppled over onto the floor, hitting my head on the seat next to me. The room spun madly and I clung onto the legs of the chair for dear life. My overcoat flew out of my hands and flopped around on the ground uselessly. I had no idea what was going on. Maybe this was some mad demonstration this guy had worked up for this machine. I closed my eyes and silently prayed it would stop. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; As suddenly as it started, it stopped. The room was completely still. I opened my eyes and there was bright light gleaming through the window on the door. It nearly blinded me. My eyes slowly adjusted to the light and I could make out the salesman walking up to me. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; ” You alright? ” he asked, helping me up. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; ” Yeah. ” I rubbed my head where it hit the chair. “ What happened? Was there... an earthquake? ” I asked, knowing full well that ’ s not what an earthquake felt like. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; The salesman grinned. “ I told you what it was. We ’ ve gone through time. Your parents ’ wedding should be happening any minute now. ” \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; I stared at him in disbelief. “ Okay, sure, ” I said consolingly, as one would say to a child who just told you they saw a monster in their closet. “ Sure, we ’ re back in time. Okay. I ’ m just gon na... go now, alright? ” \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; The salesman just smiled at me. “ Okay, suit yourself, ” he said again. “ You ’ ll be back. ” \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; Barely able to believe my luck, I picked up my coat, opened the door, and walked swiftly out of it. I already had my coat half-way on when I realized it was no longer cold, but balmy. The weather had changed drastically. The light that I saw didn ’ t come from a street light, but the sun itself. I stared up at it for a moment, mouth agape. I looked back at what the salesman had called a “ time machine ” but it was gone. I blinked the green dot from the sun out of my vision and started walking quickly to the street, out of the alley. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; Every car that passed was an antique in pristine condition. I stared around at the people in amazement, and they glanced at me, then averted their eyes as if I were somehow indecent. Everyone was dressed in short-sleeved shirts and either short pants, or shorts. I however, had on an undercoat, gloves, boots, and thick, woolen pants. That ’ s not to mention the overcoat I was carrying and the layer of thick underwear and the t-shirt and jeans I was wearing under my clothes. I started sweating profusely, which made everyone even more nervous to be around me. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; I ducked down into another alley and stripped down to my t-shirt and jeans. I just felt lucky that I always dressed in layers. I dumped all my other clothing in a nearby trash can after extracting everything from my pockets. Unfortunately, I still had to trudge along in my fur-lined boots. My t-shirt displayed “ Metallica ” with a picture of the entire band mid-note in a song. People still looked at my odd appearance, but not as nervously anymore. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; I recognized where I was. I was in my home town, where I had just left, only it was like my parents ’ had always described it. Mom and pop shops lined the streets with people merrily going in and out of them, chatting. I couldn ’ t believe my eyes. If what the salesman said was true, then.... \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; I ran from the side-street to the main street and looked to my right. There it was, the church where my parents were married, only a few blocks away. I ran to it and burst through the front door. I walked to the back door, cracked it open, and peered outside to where it was held. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; I could just barely see them, standing on a white, wooden gazebo with a man in a black suit between them holding a book. My dad was handsome, without his crooked nose he got from a car accident. My mom was beautiful with her long, brunette hair before it had prematurely grayed. I realized how hard I was panting from having run so far, and for seeing the unbelieveable. Nothing could ’ ve convinced me more than this sight right here. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; I closed the door and paced the church, thinking hard. *Could he be telling the truth? Could I really be back in time? Is this a psychotic break? It sure doesn ’ t feel like it. If it can send me back here, where else can he take me? * I stopped in my tracks as the thoughts of where I could go exploded through my mind. *I could go back and see Jesus. I could go see his miracles for myself. Noah ’ s ark. The first fish that flopped out of the ocean. I could prove empirically what happened. No one would wonder anymore because I could give them absolute proof. * \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; I ran out of the church and back down to the alley where the time machine had vanished. To my dismay, the machine still had not returned. *He knew I ’ d be back. He has to return, he just has to! * As I thought this, I heard a loud **Whoosh** behind me and spun around. There it was. This magnificent machine. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; The salesman opened the door and looked at me with one eyebrow raised. “ Well? ” \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; I laughed and panted while sputtering, trying to get out words. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; ” Will you take it? ” he asked. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; ” Will I take it?! ” I repeated loudly. “ Of course I ’ ll take it. I ’ m just wondering what it ’ ll cost! Something like this has to be worth millions of dollars! ” \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; ” Money? Honestly, I have no need for money. If I wanted money, I could simply go back in time and place stocks in the right company. Or get the correct lottery numbers. Or a dozen other ways to make money with time. No. I ’ m not looking for money, ” he said, eyeing me. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; My panting started to subside. “ Not money... Then, what ’ ll it cost? ” \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; ” Nothing, ” the salesman said simply.\n"}

Daddy called him his little man - just six years old, and already riding his bike with no training wheels. Riding bikes was a little scary, but Mommy was there to help when he got all wobbly. He'd only skinned his knee once, and that time, Mommy had given him a kiss and a Pooh-Bear bandaid. That had made it feel better. Daddy had gotten a little angry at him when he'd cried, but Mommy had been there to hug him. \n \n Mommy always told him that big boys were n't afraid of the dark, but Tim still felt afraid now. There was something under his bed. Something big, dark, and scary. He could feel it. Sometimes he thought he heard laughing. \n \n `` I-is anyone there?'' Tim asked. \n \n `` Nope,'' a gravelly voice responded. \n \n `` MOOOOOOOOOM!'' \n \n -- -- \n \n Tim felt the presence again, but he did n't care. \n \n `` Boo!'' \n \n `` Go away, you stupid monster!''

The voice sounded distraught. \n \n Tim sobbed noiselessly. All he wanted was another hug from Mommy. Another morning of waking up to her pancakes, another chance to tell her that he loved her.

They rocked him back and forth, comforting him. \n \n -- -- \n \n `` Hey Tim.'' \n \n `` Hello, Mr. Monster.'' \n \n `` How're you feeling?'' \n \n `` A little better, I guess.'' \n \n Tim felt a slight smile. \n \n `` I'm glad to hear that.'' \n \n `` Mr. Monster, what do you look like?

Hell freezing over is a terrible tragedy, and usually a sign of the end times. It was simply too great a feat to have the Prince of Darkness owing you. “ Ah right, of course. The deal. Well, I do happen to have use of your services, though my request is a bit peculiar. I'm afraid I require a human soul, and not any random soul. I'll need the mad Arab, Abdul Alhazred. ” \n \n The Devil seemed puzzled. “ That ’ s it? You can ask for anything, and you simply want the soul of a madman. ” \n \n I nodded. “ It wo n't be any problem, will it? I feel as if it's a rather simple request. ” \n \n He snapped his fingers, bringing a contract to bear. It was signed in blood, in a scrawl that one could never assume to be human. It was exactly what I was looking for. I idly took it from his claw. I wanted to take a moment and rub this in once more, but he had already disappeared before I could make another comment. I crinkled my nose in disgust. His absence had left a stench of brimstone. From experience on the subject, that would be a challenge to get rid of. \n \n “ You can come out now. ” I called to the darkness. \n \n A sweet female voice called back. “ Is this any different from robbing Peter to pay Paul? ” She pulled the contract from my hand, inspecting it. \n \n “ I would prefer the term brokering.

I must ask though, how far back do your deals go? What did you even ask for in the first place? ” Lady Death put the contract away, apparently satisfied with the contents. \n \n I shrugged. “ Hell if I know, but ever since I've kept good company.

There had been much debate in his head as to when he should arrive, the devil's business hours are not available on google. Did it even matter? Surely the devil was a ubiquitous being? Or was he just a man with a schedule like everybody else? What if he was in a meeting? Robert would just have to wait. The location too, was not something that the former network engineer was confident in. He was making the assumption that he could just turn up at any crossroads in the country, and this one was only a couple of stops on the Northern line. Plus there was that new Tesco Express if he got hungry waiting for the devil. Robert was unassuming, mid-thirties with glasses. He looked like a network engineer, employment status notwithstanding. In his left hand he carried a briefcase that he had fished out of the attic the day before, it had belonged to his father, a much more successful man than Robert. In it was a rather poor attempt at a contract he had drawn up on OpenOffice. It stated, in rather clumsy legal terms, that Mr. Robert Johnson esq, would sell his soul to the devil in exchange for success in all areas of his life, with great emphasis on his romantic life, which at current consisted of one girlfriend he had had for a day in primary school and a disturbingly well organised external hard drive of HD porn. \n \n Robert leant against the wall of the station. He wanted to look cool when the devil showed up. After several minutes of looking at his phone, Robert looked around, trying to spot the devil from afar. How would he appear? In a puff of red smoke? Was he one of the people around him? The station attendant perhaps? He did n't look like the devil. But then how would he know? Robert was deep in thought, weighing up the probability of the devil working in the tesco express when he was approached by a man who was talking on the phone. \n \n `` Yeah look, I do n't care what his agent says tell him Mission Impossible Five will go ahead with or without him.'' \n \n Robert turned around and looked at the man. He was a young man, wearing a cheap grey suit. His hair was jet black and he had some fashionable stubble going on. He looked like he worked in Phones4U. \n \n `` Robert Johnson?'' The man asked, pocketing his phone. \n \n `` Uh, yes, that's me'' Replied Robert. \n \n `` I'm the devil, nice to meet you.'' He said, shaking his new client by the hand. `` I understand you're interested in selling your soul?'' \n \n Robert adjusted his glasses. `` Well yes, I am considering it.'' He fumbled with his briefcase and retrieved his crumpled contract. `` I've laid out my terms in here.'' \n \n The devil laughed `` ha, oh no, sorry, we do n't need that.'' He chuckled. He touched the stapled sheets of paper and they turned to ash in his hands. \n \n `` Here,'' the devil summoned a parchment in a small flash of red fire. `` I'm assuming you want the life success package? If you'll just sign at the bottom here.'' He said, handing Robert a heavy silver pen. \n \n Robert signed. \n \n `` So I'll be a success from now on?'' He smiled. \n \n `` Of course!'' Exclaimed the devil, `` However, customer experience may vary and success may be throttled at peak times. Terms and conditions apply.'' \n \n Thrilled with his new prospects, Robert thanked the devil and marched into Tesco for a meal deal. He put his items on the counter at the checkout. The cashier was an attractive young blonde. Robert decided to begin his successful life. \n \n `` That'll be three pound then please'' She said. \n \n `` There you are,'' Robert replied, handing her a sweaty five pound note. `` Would you like to go to dinner with me tonight?'' \n \n `` Fuck off, four-eyes.''

I still remembered the chant to that day and I had to try it again. \n \n I went the local beggar camp. I told a beggar I would give him some food if he repeated the chant. So he did and I did my end and I blacked out. I woke up, the beggar was dead. The moment of truth what did my arm say? 46. Oh my god it worked. I felt bad, so bad but I was excited. \n \n I did this for a while trying to trick people. My parents passed after a while, then my brother, then my brother ’ s children. All until I had no family. I never aged. I always kept the same. I had killed so many people. My counter was at 2000. \n \n I lived my life traveling joining army's everything I could do. \n \n 1836 \n \n That was the number when I first tried to kill myself. I jumped into a river and drowned myself. I was saved. 1834, I angered a bull who stabbed me with its horn. I was stretched up before I bled out. 1837 I engaged in a bar brawl. I was stabbed 13 times. I woke up in a trash pile. My wounds were magically never there. I could n't die. \n \n What had I done? I had to live my life for 1,834 more years. Oh god. \n \n I've fought many battles. Killed many people, I have taken many aliases. Michelangelo, Christopher Columbus, George Washington, Darwin, J.F.K. I faked my death many times to take on new lives. \n \n Now my number is at 1. I do n't know if I should add more time, or should I finish my life. My name is Socrates, Abraham, Johnathan. I am an Atheist. And I have one year to live. \n\n"}

Mom always seems so upset when he goes away, I dont know why, she doesnt say. Tears stream down her face and I sometimes hear her pleading with dad not to go, that we have enough money now and that he can close his business down. I sometimes ask mom why she is upset and try to comfort her. I hug her and tell her dad will be home soon. I miss him too when he goes on his business trips. \n I dont really understand what these business trips are, mom tells me that dad is very busy and has to meet important people to take care of stuff in the office. \n \n Its strange though because I sometimes hear dad talking to other people, the people always look around like they are nervous and dont like me. I see them sometimes hand dad a paper bag, like what my mum packs my lunch in for school. And then dad goes away with his big suitcase. \n \n Yesterday some people came, they told my dad that there was business to take care of, and that he had to help some people make arrangements with God. That's odd though because I thought people only got to see God when they die. They hand dad a piece of paper, I think I see a picture of someone. Dad mumbles something back to them but I dont hear it. They have a suitcase that they open and theres lots of money. I guess his business made lots of money these friendly men bought to him. \n \n Dad takes the suitcase and shakes their hands. Then suddenly they take both of dads hands and say something about Police. Mom runs into the room crying, pleading with them to let dad go. I run down the stairs, and dad is shocked to see me, he thought I was already asleep. I ask the men what they are doing with my dad. Why have they come for him? \n \n One of the men shows me a badge that says FBI and has a picture of him. He says that my dad has been bad, that he had hurt lots of people and that he needs to go to jail. \n \n Everything falls into place, the money, the men, the pictures, the whispering, the business trips with the big suitcase, it all makes sense now. My dad kills people and now the police are taking him away forever.\n"}

Captain Richards cried out. He, along with Corporal Willis, were running down a white corridor. The lights flickered, and hushed whispers could be heard from all angles. `` Captain, whats going on?!'' Willis yelled. `` Shit...'' Richards trailed off. `` CAPTAIN?!'' Willis cried. Richards grabbed Willis and turned his head around, `` It's here....'' He whispered. They slowly walked south, the sound of footsteps getting louder. A loud creaking noise coming from the roof filled Willis with dread. `` Captain...'' Willis inquisited, trembling. `` Yes, Willis?'' Richards asked, not realising the situation. `` It's....It's above us...'' Willis said in a muted tone. Suddenly, a team of soldiers appeared from a door about ten metres away. `` Sentinel team 2 here, Russian division! Identify yourselves!'' yelled out one of the soldiers. A sickening crack was audible to all of the soldiers. `` GET DOWN!'' Richards yelled, as he and Willis darted to the soldiers and fell to the ground. Where Richards and Willis were standing, the roof fell to the ground. Willis and Richards stood up, and pointed their guns towards the cloud of rubble along with the russian soldiers. `` You never answered my question.'' The Russian from before asked, still looking down the sights of his gun. Richards replied, `` Captain Richards of Sentinel team 5, New Zealand and Australian division.''. `` Warrant Officer Grudnoff, nice to meet you, sheep shagger.'' The Russian responded. Grudnoff had a team of about 6 Russian soldiers. The fog started to clear. `` Ready your weapons!'' Richards yelled out. In the fog stood something that would scar the soldiers for the rest of their lives. `` What the fuck....'' Grudnoff whispered. There was a man standing in the fog. He was ten foot tall, wearing a suit. The thing that tormented the soldiers was its face. It did n't have one. Tentacles rose from it's back as it slowly inched towards the soldiers. \n \n Hey guys, i've run out of time to write today. If you want me to write more please just let me know.

What they meant, of", "human": "Petty Officer Beachman was a hard man, is what all the cadets in Death Camp Foxtrot would say. What they meant, of course, was that Petty Officer Beachman had a rare condition, one he took great pains to conceal, that caused him to be constantly erect. He flipped his member into his waistband and untucked his shirt before stepping out of his tent. Gone were the days when he could hide his life long embarrassment behind a chain-chuck held low, or, recalling even more distant memories, a cheap public school tablet. The recent trend back towards tight clothes did n't help matters either. And while we're on the subject, Cadet Knowles had once again ordered a uniform one size too large. \n \n `` Ca*det! *'' PO Beachman screeched, the nonspecific nature of his screech causing the newer recruits to jump into even stricter formation. Their chain-chucks flopped flaccidly at their shoulders, and PO Beachman heaved a small sigh in the back of his mind. The soldiers who had been here for almost the full year of their training ignored it, because they knew exactly who was being screeched at. \n \n `` SIR, ME, SIR?'' Screamed Cadet Knowles. \n \n `` YES YOU, YOU SON OF A RETARDED TEST TUBE BABY'' howled Beachman, even louder than before to assert dominance. \n \n `` SIR, what seems to be the trouble, SIR?'' \n \n `` When the *FUCK* did I say anything about a problem you miserable sack of SHIT?'' \n \n `` SIR I assumed you were insulting me for a reason SIR'' \n \n `` DO I NEED A REASON TO INSULT YOU, CADET?'' \n \n `` Sir, no, sir'' \n \n `` FUCK YOU, CADET KNOWLES. YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHY YOUR UNIFORM IS LOOSE AGAIN?'' \n \n The young Knowles perked up, secretly. The plan was coming together. \n \n `` SIR, I do n't know, must have been some kind of mixup SIR.'' \n \n `` Does your army *make mistakes*, CADET *KNOWLES? *'' \n \n `` SIR, no, sir.'' \n \n The Petty Officer was really very upset. There was a rumor going around the Death Camp that he was never promoted beyond Petty Officer because Colonel Hurt wanted to teach him a lesson about being petty. But Beachman was far too focused on his boner for the lesson to do much good. This was the reason he did n't get put on field duty, left instead to care for the new recruits. \n \n Cadet Knowles trembled a bit with the humor of his next jibe in mind, waiting for the delicious smell of an angry voice's breath on his uniquely small nose. \n \n `` Sir, I have a question, sir'' was quieter than the exchange had been because he was half hoping the Petty Officer would miss it, but loud enough for it to still look like he made the effort. Petty Officer Beachman did n't miss it. He snapped his head around and his neck cracked audibly, and he marched right up to arm's reach like an enraged soccer or bear mother. \n \n `` Ca*det*!'' He screeched even louder than before. There was a sound of giggling almost beginning. `` The *fuck* do YOU WANT?'' His spit blew in the air and laughter was just barely not there yet. \n \n `` Sir'' he asked in a calm, but loud voice, `` why do you get to untuck your shirt and we do n't? It looks comfortable and --'' `` AND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO CRITICIZE MY MOTHERFUCKING UNIFORM, KNOWLES? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? TO BE INSUBORDINATE TO YOUR SUPERIOR OFFICER?'' \n \n `` SIR, NO SIR, I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF THERE WAS A REASON YOUR SHIRT WAS UNTUCKED, SIR?'' Cadet Knowles quickly and respectfully matched Beachman's volume. \n \n `` Well, I've got news for you, kid. Kids. You want to know *why* my shirt is untucked? You wan na'know the big secret', do you, you *FUCKERS*?'' The last word made even Cadet Knowles jump. `` Well?'' The cadets looked and listened attentively. \n \n `` Well fuck you, that's why. Do n't *QUES*tion your superior OFFICER. I wear *what I want*. Because I'm your superior OFFICER.''\n"}

What could it mean? \n \n Stanley decided to go to the meeting room. Perhaps he had simply missed a memo. \n \n... a*hem*. \n \n Stanley decided to *go to the meeting room*. The door out of his office was halfway open - it provided a tantalising glimpse into the hub of cordoned-off cubicles outside. Computers beeped, but there was no telltale click of keys to indicate any sign of human life, and a telephone could be faintly heard ringing fruitlessly in the middle-distance. Some of the chairs even looked *upturned* - sprawled on their backs on the threadbare carpet, wheels still turning faintly in the air. Whatever had so efficiently purged these offices of any human life appeared to have done so rather quickly. The light from the flourescent rods on the office's ceiling bled through the crack, reaching into Stanley's dark room like a outstretched arm, and *beckoned* to Stanley. \n \n Stanley did *not* simply sit in the swivel chair in his office, placing his scuffed shoes on the desk to the left of his keyboard as he... what's that? What's that *gesture* supposed to mean?! \n \n... well, you know what, that's *fine by me*. \n \n Without any warning, the door slammed shut. The lock clicked, pointedly. Clearly, Stanley was now trapped in this office until he chose to co-operate. \n \n Yes. This office. This *scintillating*, enrapturing, *dreary* little office. Yes, clearly, trivial matters like narrative flow and a well-constructed opening for a story *paled* in comparison to the opportunity to spend one more moment in this precious, *precious* office. With its computer, and its- \n \n... Stanley? Stanley, what are you doing? \n \n *Oh! * I see! Stanley was currently using his implausibly-durable stapler to knock out a loose bolt on the ventilation duct! It took effort, and his hands shook with it, but with a final whack of the stapler the bolt came loose and flew down to the plastic-tiled floor, skittering away at Stanley's feet. After that, he planted his gangly legs on the ventilation grill in front, and after lying on his back for support he put all his weight into the *push*... \n \n... muscles strained, and pain burned through his trembling legs, but he did it! The vent popped, and the grill clattered backwards with a cacophonous *clang*. Lurching forward into a sitting position, Stanley scooped it out before clambering tightly into the vent himself. He started scurrying, in a desperate bid for freedom, sliding forward on the cold metal as his hands hauled at anything they could. \n \n Well, that was exciting, was n't it? And you managed to use a bit of the Air-Vent Passageway... well, it's a bit of a Dead Horse Trope these days, I must admit, but we ca n't really expect James Joyce out of you, now can we? Well *done*, Stanley! \n \n Do you see what I'm trying to say here? You've *deliberately* tried to escape my story, to *spoil* the little narrative I've set up around here, and you've *still* wandered right in the middle of it! You've made it *better*! Maybe you should turn back - oh, but then you're out in the offices again, are n't you? The way *I* planned it! \n \n Stanley kept on crawling, into the dark. It was *very* dark. A chill burned through his nerves, as if they were frosting over beneath his skin, and he *knew* it was from more than just the icy touch of the metal biting at his palms. \n \n The dark. The unexplained. Stanley was crawling right into it. Stanley did n't *want* to know what was lurking up ahead, what *crawled* in the nest of vents and wires like a worm in a pustule, burrowing into the flesh and *watching* him with milky, blank eyes. He did n't want to know how its thick, grey tongue pressed against its teeth, or what that sound was, that sound getting ever closer, that sound like a thousand tiny hailstones skittering off a tin roof. \n \n Stanley wanted *freedom* from the narrative! Freedom where anything could happen next, or happen *to him* next! And as his heart hammered in his throat and he blindly slithered forward, groping in the dark, well, here it came! His *freedom! * \n \n... or, you know what, let's try something different. \n \n Suddenly, the vent beneath Stanley's struggling form gave a plaintive, fatal creak, and he had a second to pull back before his cramped little metal world fell out from under him. The floor of the vent gave a wail and fell downwards, down and down and down before landing with a clatter on the floor of a corridor. At least it looked like that - he could see carpet, to be sure, but the only dim light in the darkness trickled from a door he could n't see, at the corridor's end. \n \n Stanley hunched, shivering, between the tight walls of the vent around him, and let out a shaky exhale. At the very least, whatever was on the other side of the ventilation shaft appeared to have been scared off. \n \n I hope you've learned a valuable lesson from all this, Stanley. \n \n You could have kept on wandering. I would n't have even had to write in anything - I could have just kept the vents going for a few hundred more paragraphs, or thrown in a flash-forward. And when you slumped forward, starving, and the rats came out of the woodwork to pick you clean - well, that'd have been *freedom*, now would n't it? You'd have defied my story, at least. \n \n But groping forward, blindly, into the muck and the dark and the chaos - is that what you want, Stanley? Is that any way to live? You *need* me, Stanley, and I need you - but we do n't have to be at each other's throats like this! You scurry along my story for me and - well - who knows? There could be a happy ending for *both* of us! You might even be *really* free! \n \n *So*. Stanley decided that further attempts to examine the ventilation systems for signs of human life were fruitless. Shrugging his shoulders, he squeezed himself into a turn and set off back to his office, to find where his co-workers had- \n \n... Stanley? What are you doing?! Stanley, DON'T- \n \n Stanley, *stupidly*, hurled himself out of the shattered vent and down to the corridor below. He landed, painfully, and it killed - no, he was still alive, staggering upwards and clutching what looked like a broken arm. Blood trickled from one ear. He stared at the door in front of him, and the dimly glowing light. \n \n Stanley. Stanley, this is *very important*. You *** CAN NOT *** go near that door. Stanley? Can you hear what I'm saying? DON'T- \n \n... the door opened, with a creak. It had n't been used in quite some time. Stanley leaned against it, and stared at what he saw. \n \n He saw me. \n \n... yes. Hello. I... ca n't quite imagine you were expecting me to look like *this*. \n \n He approached. With purpose, and a... Stanley? What *is* that? No, Stanley, put it DOWN! I can HELP you!

He'd had to. He'd had to do it. There'd been no other choice. His arm throbbed, dull stabs of pain, and his vision swam. He heard blood squelch, from somewhere. It could have been his own. He stumbled to the door, and swung it open. * \n \n *Freedom greeted him, like a long-lost lover. * \n \n *Fresh air caressed his throat with the taste of the finest wine. Grass swayed, and trees rustled. The Sun glowed in the rich, blue sky. Stanley stepped through the door - and it* was *just a door, now, not attached to anything, and as he slammed it shut it winked out of existence forever. He could n't hear the voice anymore. * \n \n *Stanley was* free. \n \n *And, well, I think we should let him believe that for now, do n't you? *\n"}

He'd expected drama on opening day, but this left him rather speechless. \n \n He gulped. `` Sir, I need to fetch the director for this application. A minute, please.'' \n \n Taking two steps backwards, he forced his eyes closed to shut out the visage that terrified him so. He told himself he would have time to figure out things later, assuming he survived this, and turned to find his boss. \n \n The floor creaked a bit as he knocked on the door of the director's office. Levi was as good natured a bureaucrat as you would ever meet, and Ulysses desperately needed instruction for this situation. His thoughts turned briefly to stiff drink. \n \n `` Enter.'' \n \n `` Sir, we have a situation. This applicant he... he states he is from the future, and he is telling the truth. He has already filled out the papers for his invention of... traversing time.'' \n \n Levi sat slackjawed and stroked his beard. Ulysses nodded. It was half a minute until he got his response. \n \n `` We must ensure everything is in order and then accept the application as with any other. This is a historical moment and by God, I do n't know what else to do. Follow.'' \n \n Levi stood and walked towards the front lobby. He reflected on how he had always wanted to be an ambassador, but not like this. Opening his mouth to greet his important visitor, his eyes widened and he instead merely screamed. \n \n At the front counter was the man as described, normal enough beyond his alien uniform. At issue, however, were the two new arrivals behind him. The first was very much not a man, although whatever it was did not seem entirely unlike a cross between a levitating octopus and a steam engine. The last he could only recognize as some sort of half-metal person. \n \n The octopus-engine's assortment of eyes twinkled at Levi, and Levi understood his intentions, although none were spoken out loud. Essentially, it was to be known as **GLYXMAR, ** and while it was very polite and patient with Levi during the duration of the telepathic exchange, and appropriately understanding of how unsettling such telepathy might be when first experienced as a grown man of the 19th century, **GLYXMAR** imparted that it was of the utmost importance that it be recognized as the inventor of traversing time. When Levi finally responded to the thought-inquiry in an intelligible way, it was, of course, with fear and revulsion. **GLYXMAR** took it upon himself to begin rewriting Levi's neural patterns so that he would be able to process his application. \n \n `` STOP!'' shouted the metal man, in perfect English. `` This is an uncomfortable situation for us all, but you are *not* to take command of this man, **GLYXMAR**. We are to let these people decide what to do. It is, after all, their patent law.'' \n \n **GLYXMAR** relented, although this resulted in Levi gasping for air, falling to his hands and knees, tears streaming from his face. \n \n The only human customer of the three looked at the metal man and nodded, and gave **GLYXMAR** a dirty look. They had a brief consulation over the course of about a half second, the man on some sort of holographic display, **GLYXMAR** with a pattern of eye-twinkles and the metal man via wireless means. \n \n Ulysses was crouched in the corner. Levi was heaving on the ground. The future man spoke to them, knowing full well the damage was done. \n \n `` We are sorry for all this. We will come back tomorrow.'' \n \n They left, the door bell jingling.\n"}

His right hand gripped a kitchen knife tight enough to turn his knuckles white. \n \n `` You do n't want to do this,'' Rachel whispered the words from her tied up position, elevated so that her feet hung inches above the ground. She stared at Jay, eyes wet with tears. `` I wo n't tell anyone what you are. You still save people.

The friendly commercials that spouted the amazing truth... \n \n *Do you ever wish to live a life... and another... and another? Well, wish no more! Try Vivadoz! One pill, taken before bedtime, will allow you to dream an amazing adventure, and wake up refreshed and ready to tackle the day! * \n \n Vivadoz was a hit, of course. Everyone wanted to escape their every day, and have an adventure, all without leaving their home. \n \n The idea is this: You take The Pill, and then think about where you want to be, what you want to be doing... and the vivid dreams begin while you sleep. Better than a Star Trek Holodeck. Kayaking in a mountain valley? Flying a fighter jet? Exploring Mars? Watching a supernova up close? \n \n Nothing was off limits. Whatever you could dream up, The Pill would give you... all you have to do is get 6-8 hours to do it. \n \n But then... oh, the insidiousness of the pleasure that Pill gave people. The drug companies knew what they were doing. They were like pushers. They were damn near *giving the drug away* as soon as the FDA trials were over. The pharmas made an absolute *killing* selling the thing. And the best part? No after effects were observed. No danger. Completely harmless. Just awesome sleep, right? \n \n Yes, absolutely! Incredible sleep. More than anything else, sleep was the best thing a person could do in their life now. The drug was everywhere. If you wanted it, you got it. And you slept. Wake up... get some food, take a pee break... then sleep, and another adventure. \n \n Nobody kept track of anyone else... anything else... Because everyone wanted to sleep. Everywhere. Nobody escaped the lure of The Pill. \n \n And then... it happened. Someone figured out the formula... and it was *simple*. Kids could make it... and did. Everyone did. \n \n And so that was that... the world ended. \n \n Well, not literally, Earth's still orbiting the sun. Animals are still about. But there's not many humans living anymore. I'm one of the lucky bastards... if you want to call me that... that survived The Slumbering. \n \n See, when people do nothing but sleep... then they forget things need tending. Power plants, for one. Food supplies for another. People kept neglecting things. Oh, sure, crime went way the hell down, but that's little consolation when a nuclear power plant runs out of people to run it. Or a forest fire happens and nobody's around to put the fire out. Or nobody wants to be a nurse anymore. \n \n They tried to control things, but people *rioted* to get their Pills. Struck too. No work until Pills happened. \n \n A sad statement on Humanity, really. \n \n So everything, everywhere, fell apart. Once a society got The Pill, it was over. Just a matter of time. And no society ever, EVER escaped the lure. From the politicians, to the armies, to the people in the streets and everyone everywhere in between. The Pill was humanity's abomination. \n \n And in the horror of what we'd done to ourselves...'we' chose to take some more... to forget reality... to forget the pain of living in the real world... and we died as a viable, modern society. Either animals ate us as we slept, blissfully unaware of our being consumed... or we starved as food ran out, but we dreamed. \n \n The Remainders, as we call ourselves, do n't really know why we resist... perhaps it's our statement to the Universe that we will not go quietly... or something... I do n't really know anymore. And I've kind of had enough of the harsh life I've been living since the world fell apart... \n \n So today, I made a batch. I told myself I would n't, but...

The aura around Death seemed to radiate nearly as much as power as Apocalypse, perhaps an equal amount. But while the feeling one got from Apocalypse ’ s presence was one of widespread destruction and devastation, Death ’ s was far more subtle, and just as unnerving. Death was about simply that: death. It was not about rending one ’ s head from his body. Not about ripping someone in half. \n \n No, it was about simply negating him from existence. Blanking him out, going back to the archives of all that existed and tearing his name out. It was so…. personal, it made him feel so mortal, that in an instant the Horseman realized exactly why Apocalypse had warned him against the Council member. \n \n A small shrub was growing on the ground next to him. As Death brushed by it, it immediatley lost all color and began to rot away. In the air around him, Blight began to see other wraiths, strange spirits flitting around and disappearing, only to reappear behind Blight himself. There were sounds, strange cries echoing from the bizarre entities that surrounded their master. \n \n There was a reason why Death was considered the most feared member still on the Council in higher circles of entities of Blight ’ s power, not that there were many. It was because the army he commanded was the largest in history. That was because he commanded every army in history, and they obeyed him unquestionably. But Blight was surprised not to have encountered more of his servants. It seemed like Death had made it his business to confront Blight and send a message to Apocalypse. \n \n For Blight had taken Apocalypse ’ s word to heart. His words were caught in his throat as the wraith wafted closer to him ever so slowly. For the first time in his existence, he knew what true fear was. He was paralyzed. He knew deep down that men who ran from Death were fools. Once Death decided to find you, it was better to get it over with. \n \n Still, he tried. He screamed and fired off a gigantic sphere of pure white energy right in Death ’ s face. It slammed into the wraith ’ s head, momentarily throwing his hood back before it simply passed off into the distance. For that mili-second when Blight saw the Council member ’ s identity, his true face, he was sapped of all resistance. He went pale. \n \n Death pulled his hood forward calmly, and reached over with his hand. His index finger touched Blight ’ s shoulder, and he could feel his pulse begin to weaken. His vision grew hazy, and for a moment, his heart began to thump extra fast before slowing down imperceptibly. He couldn ’ t think clearly, so he couldn ’ t even move away to escape Death ’ s touch. \n \n He knew it was coming. It was a sensation he had never felt before, and he was glad he would never feel it again. Just as he felt his lungs seize up, refusing to draw one more labored breath, he heard a voice he could have never been more glad to hear. \n \n “ Move away, Death. Your business is with me. Not my Horseman. ” \n\n"}

It was dark in the cave they were hiding out in, but the firelight illumined the path the salty water took down her cheek. She brushed the tear and turned away from Adam. \n \n “ Charlotte, I DO love you. I love you more than the world itself. Where would I be without you? Please don ’ t think I ’ m ungrateful for the things that you ’ ve done for me ” \n \n And he was grateful. He truly was. Most virgins didn ’ t make it past the age of 28. They were hunted and executed without mercy by those who could wield the power. Without Charlotte ’ s help, Adam would never have been able to escape the city. \n \n “ Oh, you love me, but not enough to show me. I see how things are ”, Charlottte ’ s voice was filled with contempt. And rightfully so thought Adam. This women had risked her life for their love, left everything she had and everyone she knew. And now here he was, spitting on her sacrifice. \n \n “ Charlotte, my birthday is in 2 days; if we could just wait until then… ” \n \n But Charlotte cut him off, “ So you can get your precious powers and then LEAVE ME! Don ’ t lie to me Adam, I ’ ve seen the way you look at other women. Once you have the power and no longer need me you ’ ll just cast me off to the side. I can ’ t believe I was so stupid. I should have never let myself be this vulnerable ”. Charlotte was shaking her head and sobbing. \n \n “ No, I don ’ t even really care about the powers. I just… ” \n \n But Charlotte shot a glare at him and once gain interrupted, “ Adam, I don ’ t care about the powers either. I just want to live a happy and simple life. I want to wake up next to you and fall asleep next to you. I want to laugh and grow old with you. I ’ m not saying what we have will be perfect. But I think it can be perfect for us. ” She turned away again and the firelight let off a soft glow against the profile of her face. Her big and beautiful wet eyes were glistening. Her chest quivering in obvious pain beneath her simple white dress. \n \n Adam was at a loss for words. Since his mid 20s, he had made the decision to abstain until he had the gift bestowed upon him. Charlotte was the only woman he had ever met who made him question his choice. She was beautiful, but more than that she understood Adam. When he was with her, he felt.. he felt at home. He knew he wouldn ’ t leave her once he got his powers, but Adam was also starting to see her point. He sat in cold silence for a while. The minutes seemed to stretch on for hours. Charlotte remained quiet, save the occasional sobs that escaped from her. \n \n Adam firmly came to a decision. He knew what he wanted in his life and he knew what was truly important. He stood up and walked around the fire pit to Charlotte ’ s side. \n \n “ I love you Charlotte, and I will do anything to prove my love to you ”. \n \n Adam grabbed her face and kissed her deeply. Charlotte broke away and looked up at him. The edges of her mouth slowly turned up. She smiled at him, and once again Adam was home. They embraced each other, made gentle love and fell asleep in each other ’ s arms. \n \n *** \n \n The next day Adam awoke with a start. He was cold and saw that the fire had reduced to smoldering coals during the night. I must get some more firewood he thought as he sat up. \n \n He jumped. There was a man sitting in the cave. On a golden throne. Adam had no idea how that could have gotten there, and he had no idea how this man had found him; but he instantly recognized him. \n \n Baltazar was sitting in a forest green silk robe. His long blonde hair cascaded behind his back. A glow of warmth surrounded him despite the chill that the cave gave off. This man radiated authority and a stern, yet smug smile was etched on his face as he stared at Adam. A white raven sat perched on Baltazar ’ s shoulder also stole a glance at Adam and gave a short caw. \n \n But the Baltazar wasn ’ t alone. Behind him was another person. She was robed in a tight black dress which showed off her bodice. A wicked sneer grew upon her face as Adam awoke and saw her. She had an arm wrapped over Baltazar ’ s shoulder and her hand was lying on his chest, caressing it. Charlotte ’ s beauty was amplified as she stood next to the great Wizard and a sinking feeling began to rise in Adam ’ s stomach. \n \n Baltazar spoke, his deep voice echoing throughout the cave, “ Good Morning Adam ” \n\n"}

His face had drained of colour and he started babbling some incomprehensible phrase. `` Great'' I thought to myself. I had spent the best part of an hour interviewing him, and every time I got even close he would go into this trance-like state. \n \n I stood up and turned to leave. He was useless now. However, just as I was leaving he spoke again. \n \n `` It's not what they say.'' \n \n I turned around to face him. \n \n `` What's not what they say? And who are they?'' \n \n His face, old and wrinkled, bore a grin. `` The teleportation device was a success. You know that. I know that. It was perfect in every way. But it did n't end up being perfect. \n \n It started, oh I'd say twenty years ago. When I first started working on the project. Project T.A.V.P.U, I think that was what they called it. Something about transporting atoms through universes. Well, I started building the machine. Figuring out the physics as we went along. After, a good few months, we'd made some progress, but in the wrong direction. The parallel universe theory was bullshit. So we came up with another plan. This time it was something slightly more drastic. \n \n We needed a relay for it to work. Originally meant to be a satellite, we'd simply beam the atoms up to the satellite, then beam them back down again. Easy as pie. Well turns out our grant was cut down. We were left with barely any money. We had barely enough to continue the project. We even had to steal pipes from the scrapyard. Do you realise how humiliating it was, for me, an esteemed scientist, to steal from a scrap heap? Well-'' \n \n His sentence was cut short by his body beginning to tremor. His eyes rolled back, and he kept repeating some unintelligible phrase. I was about to call for help, when he suddenly stopped, as if nothing happened. \n \n He began to speak again. `` Well we finished the machine. It took fifteen long years, but we did it. It was a prototype, but I thought it was beautiful. I had created the most important piece of human technology ever made. I vividly remember it shining, radiating an aura of pure brilliance. And I had helped to make it. However, we still needed a quick fix to the problem of a relay. the relay-'' \n \n Again his body shook, and he turned his head up and started repeating a his phrase again. However, I could just make out a sequence of As, and possibly some Gs. \n \n After a couple of seconds he calmed down, and spoke, but his voice seemed more hoarse this time. `` The relay of course was a problem, but we had come up with a quick fix. A temporary fix. I know this sounds barbaric, but we needed a human to be the relay for now. It was simple- it would give the DNA a rough template to form, then the teleporter could work through the rest. Sounds horrible, inhumane, but hey, we used a braindead person. He would n't be able to feel, we'd have our temporary relay. And it worked. Marvellously. The only problem was that, after a while, we realised-'' \n \n Dr. Fer shook more violently this time, convulsing in agony, screaming a phrase. I made out `` ACT G...'' then a repetition of this of sorts. He took longer this time to return to his calm self, and seemed out of breath, and visibly traumatised. \n \n `` We realised he was n't fully braindead. And no, do n't cut me off yet! There's more. I know it sounds horrible, but we kept using him. Over and over again. We teleported ourselves more and more. Only to discover something. We knew our patient had put himself in the coma, as he slit his own wrists. And somehow, he incorporated that into the DNA sequence we sent through him. Sharp corners and edges became more and more appealing to us. We were drawn to them, like a dog is to fresh meat.'' \n \n He paused, with a harrowed look in his eyes. \n \n `` Twelve of my team died. They all slit their own wrists. Just as the patient had.'' \n \n He looked at me, tears welling up. \n \n `` And yet the facility still wanted to use the machine. I tried to stop them, but they would n't listen. So, think about it. Millions of billions of people, all about to be relayed through this poor man's head. All of them would kill themselves. We had n't created a teleporter. We'd created a device for mass genocide. So we did the only thing we could do.'' \n \n He stopped and looked me in the eyes. \n \n He said, in a whispery ghostly voice `` I became the relay.'' \n \n He shuddered, and began convulsing, more and more violently. I turned to run, shouting for help. All I could hear from behind me were screams of a sequence. A sequence that would haunt me forever. \n \n `` ATG! ACG! GTC!...''\n"}

The operator cackled into the microphone, barely audible on the other side, the sound only amplified by walls of the limestone cavern. \n \n The slender man pulled a crusted and black index finger to the headset which was almost invisible underneath the the thick sediment that sat atop the man's head -- a testament to his decades spent in the under-earth. He began to speak into the headset -- but stopped, a habit hard to break. `` Who else is going to do it?'' He thought. `` Who else but me has toiled high and low in sweet and in sorrow with neither the wind nor the touch of life or the sun, or the foundation upon which life has sprung itself to soothe my Self!'' \n \n His long years spent underground had made him bitter yet peaceful. His long years searching had made him mentally fatigued and withdrawn. He knew it was too late to care, that there was no point and this addition will be as tedious as the last and the next and the one after that. He knew that the under-earth will become as vile and corrupt, and as stagnant of soul and replete of malice as the over-earth had some time millions of years ago. \n \n The under-earth was necessary. The planet had been starved and the last great war had set up vast networks of Hyperion-grade phaser cannons just outside the earth's atmosphere that could be set off like dominoes in a mutually assured destruction of what little of the planet remained. So we sat underneath the charred and dusty surface of a once vibrant planet. Tucked away in titanium walled rooms like ants betwixt dizzying series of tunnels and highways and Transportubes. Governments now able to block off and defend their territory from all angles, the repercussions were dire for any citizen that did n't manage to dig their way to and unexplored area. Forced matings, food was basically non-existent, earthquakes were increasingly dangerous, books as we know them are extinct, replaced by neuronal-resonance devices that were amplified by the iron and ore in the earth and worked similar to radio, broadcasting state-run media, the only kind of media, really, and a state of perpetual war threatened the final frontier. \n \n `` Confirmation number, Mr. Fero.'' He had been holding his breath so long, another one of those habits. He returned, `` 54-MENWICK 237, looks like 3 individuals, a male and 2 androids. Signs of struggle. Electron-migrocometer showing traces of electron pulse gun use. Human severely charred from waist down.'' \n \n `` Bag'em up and catalog the human.'' \n \n He reached down and began picking up the belongings from around the lifeless human body, lying naked on the ground: a long wooden and metal staff, a bag full of stones and a glass transporTube card. He did n't wonder anymore, there was nothing new here, he had seen them in all shapes and forms, some reduced to a brackish red jelly on the dirt floors that the androids had poisoned with cellular chromeatoph. \n \n Mr. Fero reached into his yellow bag and pulled out the cornea remover, for proper categorization, the cornea's had to be removed and identified, also so the color rods can be cloned for blindness vaccines. He used his thumb and forefinger to open the eyelids, and the eye moved! \n \n `` This person is n't dead!'' He yelled into the microphone, his heart thumping and adrenaline closing in on his vision. `` Calm down! Leave the area immediately!'' \n \n I'm not sure if I'm allowed to do this, this is my first post, but I want to see if anyone wants me to go on before I flesh this out!\n"}

But if they have no capacity for affection - their society will never make it off the ground.'' \n \n He looked down at the blueprints, years of work on a flight mechanism that would now go to waste. `` Goddamn budget-cutters,'' he muttered. `` If God was n't trying to build sixty million species at once, we'd be able to make ten or twelve million good ones.''\n"}

Heh. \n \n In my first moments of awareness, I found myself in some mechanical suit, soaked in what seemed like a liquid that smelt like the noxious fumes from a wheezing. But I could not move, and the fumes I breathed in somehow made me feel..... *alive*. \n \n Eventually, I grew to hear voices, that I came to recognise as other beings outside of my suit. They talked about things like DNA, mew, domination, though all I really wanted was to escape the immobilisation. \n \n It was about a week before I was freed from my capsule. Free from the noxious liquid, but still trapped in my suit. They told me that I was their ultimate creation, and that I would serve as their weapon to conquer the world. \n \n I was puzzled. \n \n They commanded me to attempt some tests, but I refused to budge. And that's when it began - the suit I was trapped in shocked me. The agony was shocking, the pain intense. \n \n And so I had no choice but to obey. To move objects with sheer willpower, to read the intentions of my test subjects. The barrage of tests were pushing the limits of my mind, and I suffered greatly. Yet, it felt oddly empowering. \n \n There were other pokemon around. They looked upon me with a haunting sadness, but obeyed every order with a resigned sigh. \n \n I could not understand - they were capable of feats that the humans were unable of. Breathing fire, producing electricity; why were they acting like servants? And then it dawned on me - as I was trapped by my shock suit, they most definitely enslaved by some unseen nefarious means. \n \n And then it happened. \n \n They wanted me to kill another pokemon. I had resisted some of their previous tests, but the shock suit held the upper hand. This time, I simply could not give in. Taking the life of a fellow slave?

I struggled to keep my mind under control, but I lost it. \n \n In the blink of an eye, my suit exploded in all directions. \n \n I was free. Free of the shock suit, free of the control. My abilities were free to use, and I smirked as I used my mind to rip my captors asunder. \n \n\n"}

We ’ re done. ” \n \n As he stood up and piled stacks of bills inside a knockoff Coach bag, Ana took a deep breath, and let it out. It didn ’ t help. \n \n For some reason, she did not feel like she had come out of this deal on top.\n"}

Kronk has messed up before in the past, alot. Captain Hook is always angry at him, telling him Mr. Smee was even better than him. Now Kronk tries his best not to mess up, yet he still does it. But little does Kronk know hes about to make the worst mistake of his life. \n \n `` Muahaha, this is my best plan yet!'' Hook laughed, `` This potion is sure to do the trick!''

Only the magnificent of all Emperors. `` Oooo I should really get ready, he will be here any minute now!'' \n \n Kronk opened the door to let the Emperor slide into Hook's humble abode. `` Hola amigos, it's me, the one, the only,'' \n \n `` Yes, yes we get it, come sit down.'' Hook states from the dining room. `` Woah there me amigo why the'tude?'' Emperor Kuzco asked. `` Enough talk, lets eat shall we? Kronk! Bring in the drinks!'' Hook yelled into the kitchen. Kronk, getting the drinks set up, grabs a potion and puts it into Kuzco's drink. `` Here you go Emperor Kuzco and Mr. Hook.'' Kronk placed the drinks down on the table. Kuzco grabs his and immediately drinks the whole thing. Hook, whos more polite, sips his, waiting patiently for the result. Suddenly, Kuzco's teeth start growing in size.

She could n't remember how she got to where she was. She could n't even tell where she was. All Achara could see was the too white tiles of a floor. \n \n A... floor? Where is she? \n \n Achara wiggles all of her fingers and toes just like her mother taught her. She carefully moves her arms and legs. Nothing felt off, just her pounding head, so she decides to sit up. \n \n The floor leads more tiles on the wall. It iss a bright white as well and just as shiny. Achara looks behind her. There was a door, and a... toilet? \n \n She looks up to a shower head. There is a drain next to her foot. To her left is a sink and mirror. \n \n Achara is in a bathroom. Great. Now what? \n \n She carefully dabs at the spot where her head hurt the most and pulls back her fingers to see... nothing. Good. She knows that head wounds can look worse than they really are, but there is something unsettling about seeing your own blood pour from your own head. Achara knows this. She knows this too well. \n \n Achara closes her eyes. *How* did she know this? \n \n She tries to remember. She tries to think back to her memories, but she ca n't remember at all. The only thing she can recollect is her name, Achara Leekpai, and that's it. \n \n She groans. All of this... not remembering she was doing is hurting her head. She gingerly holds her head, hoping some pressure will relieve the pain. Suddenly, there's a knock on the door. A jolt of pain pierces her skull. Achara holds it in. \n \n `` Miss Achara Leekpai?'' a voice says. `` You're expected to be on stage soon. Are you ready?'' \n \n `` Wh... What?'' Achara mutters. \n \n `` You sound disoriented... Are you okay? Is it okay if I come in?'' The owner of the voice does n't wait for an answer to come in. The being has on a pair of flip flops, tight black leggings, and a baggy sweatshirt. Her hair is rolled into a messy sock bun. A dual headset covers on of her ears, the microphone directly in front of her mouth, and a clipboard with many papers is in her hands. \n \n Achara could only stare at her. A giant set of *wings* protrudes from her back. `` Oh, my goodness gracious!'' the angel exclaims. She walks over, discards the clipboard, and starts fussing with Achara's hair. `` Something terrible must've happened to you! I'm so sorry, doll. You're much too pretty to be dead.'' \n \n `` D-Dead?'' Achara mutters. She expects to wince everytime angels bumps the sorest spot, but it magically starts to heal. The pain fades away. \n \n `` Yes, you're dead,'' the angel repeats. `` Did n't you... Oh, my goodness gracious! No one's explained anythi --'' \n \n She falls into silence when a small, blue light starts flashing on her headset. She presses a button and talks to someone. `` I can, but this is *your* job, Todd!'' she says angrily into the microphone before taking it off completely. It now hangs around her neck. \n \n The angel takes a deep breath before addressing the girl in front of her. `` Sorry about that, doll. My name is Tasia; I'm an angel. Usually, we are n't so rude to the recently deceased, but, I'm sorry. You're dead.'' \n \n Tasia the angel pauses to let the news sink in. Achara thinks about it. She is dead. She is dead, but still conscious. That's good, she thinks. But if she is dead, that raises the question of how she died. \n \n How did she die? Should n't someone remember something like that? Or is it too traumatic for someone to remember. \n \n Ah, ha! But she did remember something: the fact that the human body sometimes copes by repressing traumatic memories. That's a good start. \n \n But... does that actually count? She knows the head wounds are blood gushers, but she does n't remember how, why, when, or where she learned it. \n \n So, this, must mean knowledge is not equated with memories. \n \n Pleased with her recent discoveries, Achara nods. `` If I may ask, how did I die?'' \n \n Tasia gives her a small smile. `` You see, we host a game show called'Naaaame youuur deeeath.''' She stretches out the syllables like an announcer would. `` If you can guess the exact circumstances of your death, you win special prizes.'' \n \n `` Oh,'' Achara replies. Just a simple'oh'. She thinks. Now that the pain in her head is fully numbed, it's easier to think. Achara closes her eyes. Special prizes sound nice. She always like winning things... Who did n't? She is dead, so she'd certainly have a lot of time to pass. Prizes could pass that time. This is Heaven, after all. There is an angel here. She did n't have to worry. \n \n Achara opens her eyes, first spotting the tile on the ground. The floor of the shower. She looks up at Tasia. \n \n `` Okay, I'll play,'' she responds, `` but why are we in a bathroom?''\n"}

His suit fit flawlessly and the office was equipped with handsome leather furniture. I clenched my jaw at the word; they've thrown the whole DSM at me since my parents were murdered in a home invasion when I was eleven. My parents were terrified and resistant, but easily dispatched by the well-armed robbers. They spotted me standing in the threshold of my bedroom, frozen with terror, and never gave me a second glance. Within five minutes they had stripped the house of its least cumbersome valuables and left. I was n't a threat; I was n't an obstacle to their goal like my parents had been. The psychopaths that comprise the majority of the human race are n't monsters; they're goal-oriented, focused, and very self-centered. That they're complex makes them scarier. They are professional liars that can manipulate and emulate empathy with flawless accuracy; the only way to predict them is to ask, “ what do they want? ” \n \n \n These “ persecutors ” that have dominated my “ delusions ” have built a thriving society, and the doctors and therapists all insist that a race of unfeeling humans could never accomplish such things. I'm supposed to fight my delusions with irrefutable facts, but it seems logical that a society with rules and laws could easily further their self-serving tendencies. Most are hedonists: craving money, sex, power, drugs. Laws aid them because it keeps other psychopaths in-check. Every decision is carefully weighed for self-benefit; committing an obvious murder would not benefit them because they would end up in jail. Hell, even the “ peaceful exchange of power ” that makes America so “ great ” is a fantastic tool for the best and brightest liars to maximize their power without needing to worry of mutiny. My “ delusions ” tell me that the angry and volatile societies of yore were immensely more human, rife with crimes of passion and heroism that are surprisingly sparse in our comparative utopia. \n \n \n Case studies show that the cranial abnormalities that define a psychopath are expressed genetically. If “ these people ” are so successful, they will continue to grow in population. They are better adapted for our current society, and they thrive. We “ feelers ” will die out or interbreed with people who are so deft at faking emotions, we mistake them for one of our own. \n \n Fuck the doctors, the therapists, and the medication. I am not crazy. I am not delusional. This is simply how the world is, and in order to survive I must adapt. Instead of faking empathy, I will learn to fake apathy. I'll marry a woman who might not care about me at all and have kids who may curb-stomp puppies for laughs when they're still in elementary school. \n \n My palms are sweaty, my breaths are shallow, and my heart is racing. I am obviously distressed and anyone who had even a shred of humanity would be able to read it all over my face.

I was fortunate enough that nobody traveled by train at this time on a Sunday, I could easily avoid being noticed by anybody. Every Sunday I would make it point to visit my Uncle, who lived on an old farm far outside the limits of the city. Every Sunday he would have a special surprise for me, it was the same every time but it was worth every visit. \n \n I could feel the train stopping and before it could completely slow I jumped to the ground and began to run to my Uncle's farm. I could hear the crunching of gravel under my sneakers and feel the excitement shivering up and down my spine. I finally reached my Uncle's farm and made a beeline straight for the barn. In his barn he kept an old machine which he kept in a condition that rivaled it's condition straight from the production line. His dream was to keep that machine in pristine condition. \n \n I ripped the tarp off of it and eyed that brilliant, red convertible automobile again. I jumped in the driver's seat and grabbed the keys from the glove compartment; the leather felt so good against my skin. I slid the keys in the ignition, firing up the willing engine that responded with a roar. I quickly shifted into drive and sped onto the out-of-use roads, the tires spitting gravel as I committed my weekly crime. \n \n The government passed a law, you see, that made older cars like this illegal. They decided they were not safe and it was forbidden to drive them. They were replaced by aircars which were so safe that drivers would make a game out of crashing into each other, as no damage would be done to the car or the driver. There was no thrill in the aircars, no speed. You could n't feel the traction of your car speeding down a road, there was no constant threat of death from accelerating too fast down that winding cliffside road. They were dull. \n \n As I sped down the road with forest on either side of me I could feel the wind blowing through my hair, the air rushing against my face. I could smell well-weathered leather, hot metal, oil, and the country air. I could see the sunlight on chrome and the blur of the beautiful landscape. Every nerve on my body was aware of what was going on around me. I absolutely loved Sunday. \n \n As I turned a sharp corner at top speed a gleaming, alloy aircar shot toward me. The car was big enough to take two lanes on the roads I was driving on. At that moment I spun the car around, hearing the shrieking of my tires, to run this deadly race. My car screaming through the valley and I noticed through the rearview that another aircar joined the chase. I was straining the limits of machine and man as I tried to escape the aircars, who were no doubt going to crush me between them. I looked ahead to see a one lane bridge and laughed out loud with both fear and hope, I had a desperate plan. I pressed the pedal as hard as I possibly could, shooting across the one lane bridge. As I had hoped, the aircars could n't pass the bridge. Excitement from the chase was still tingling in my spine as I raced back to the barn to dream with my uncle by the fireside.\n"}

A bead of sweat slowly trickled down my forehead, and I struggled to regain my breath, desperately sucking in air while my head throbbed with pain. \n \n In front of me, the pale corpse that had tried to eat my brains, laid upon the grass in a twisted heap. Her crushed head and broken neck had swung backwards, and had been pinned underneath her withering body as she had fallen to the ground. Now her gnashing teeth were no longer snapping at me, I stood up and slowly shuffled forward for a better look. \n \n As I came within reach of the zombie's legs, I kicked her shoe, to check for a sign of life. Observing none, I stepped around to take in a full view of the dead woman; the sight of it evoked the image of a dead deer in a black-and-white movie, with her pallid skin tone, a tattered, dirty brown fur coat partially covering her upper body, muddy and worn-out black shoes giving the impression of hooves. She looked frail, and old, despite her startling speed and vice-grip strength that had been exhibited when she had chased me out of the pathology lab I had been sitting in. Luckily that spade had been leaning against a house out in the open, or... \n \n The sudden realisation of what had happened, what I had been caught up in, made me retreat to my inner sanctuary, the place where my thoughts and fantasies collided. Had I really been attacked by, and killed, a zombie? When faced with life or death, had I survived by using my own wits, or through dumb luck? I was feeling more tired and jaded as every question tumbled over and over in my mind. \n \n Just as a feeling of catatonia was beginning to descend over my shoulders and into my chest, the rapidly approaching sounds of sirens broke the spell. Upon realising that I had sunk to my knees next to the zombie, I snapped into a tall stance, and spun around. The sirens were blaring from three police cars, lights flashing and wheels screeching as they rounded the corner at the end of the street. \n \n My first thought was, thank goodness - and I began to slowly walk towards the vehicles, who all stopped suddenly in the middle of the lane. A nagging feeling started pulling at my collar, accompanied by confusion and a hint of dread. \n \n The passenger side front door on the closest car swung open first, and a police officer sprung out, pistol in hand and pointed at my head. Four more officers from the other two cars immediately did the same thing, and the driver of the closest car climbed out with a megaphone in hand. My hands automatically went out in front of me, palms facing the cars. *They think you killed her*, I thought for a moment - and my heart began to race, as the reality of the situation dawned on me. \n \n **'' HANDS ON YOUR HEAD, AND DOWN ON YOUR KNEES!!! `` ** shouted the megaphone-wielding officer in the foremost car, and the officers moved out from behind their car doors, guns still trained on me. All of them walked towards me, and the man furthest to the right reached behind his back to grab a pair of handcuffs, all while shuffling closer to me. I meekly submitted, dropping to my knees with my fingers interlocked behind my head. The coarse stones of the driveway I had stopped upon, stabbed into my knees, and I winced from the pain. \n \n The officers closed the rest of the distance at a jog, and the handcuff-wielding officer quickly attached the cuffs to my left arm. He grabbed my arms, twisted them down firmly, and completed the cuffing. Once that was done, they all bolstered their weapon, and tears began to form in my eyes - I could n't hold on, as the gravity of what was happening started sinking in. \n \n The final officer, who had dispensed with his megaphone, walked up to me as two of the policemen lifted me to my feet. His face was like black thunder, a sharp, dark, twisted stone facade that showed the hard and horrifying life he had been living, as well as the pity and revulsion he clearly held for me. \n \n He kept it simple, in a tone that sounded like how his face looked - thunderous. \n \n `` You are under arrest, for the murder of Betty White.

I can remember my first few attempts, I was so young. Seventh grade had to be the first time, it was winter,'round Christmas. Lights strung throughout the neighborhood, because of an unspoken rivalry that everybody had with each other for best decorations. I can remember how enticing that thought was at first. What if I were to end it, take it all, crumple it up and throw it away. Everyone at the time called it `` Seasonal Depression'', what an interesting way to get drugs for children, but who am I to say it was n't real? All I knew was that I had felt this way for years and it seemed I had just found the gumption to move forward with my efforts. My neighbor across the street east of my house was my Uncle. Uncle Doug, he was a guy who liked cowboys a little too much, always the guy that gave you too much shit and did n't exactly know when to stop. A rumor circulating around our family, which everyone seemed to forget for years, was that he had one love when he was young. She was involved in a car accident and died, he has n't loved since they said. In this way I found myself related, more than by blood, to my Uncle. So I only found it right to attempt to hang myself from his Christmas lights, so I hiked myself up onto his roof by way of his enormous tree in the back yard. I sat in the tree for a moment before getting onto the roof to reminisce on old days when my cousins would hang out in his tree during Christmas gatherings. I did n't want that anymore, I never wanted it really. I get onto the roof and am detaching some of the string lights from it. I finally had enough detached, now to apply the only useful thing I learned in Boyscouts, how to tie a noose. While lowering it over my head, I hear a door slam. It startled me, yes, I'm jumpy. I slid down the side of the roof hoping the lights would hold over my head, but the nails used to hold the lights in place were painters nails and could n't hold a picture frame. I landed in a bunch of snow only to be disappointed with the results. \n \n Moving forward a couple of years, my Uncle was still struggling. Though my strife does n't seem to be a kind of grieving, I felt the end result was the same when about 9 years later he was found dead in his house from a heart attack. He was diabetic and never had much to live for once both his love and dog were gone. He had stopped taking care of himself after all went to hell for him. He even tried moving to North Dakota to escape it all, but fell off of a latter there and was n't permitted to do his job thereafter. After the revocation of his license he moved back and just two years later he was gone. I was supposed to have dinner with him to try and give him some company that night, but I was a highschooler at the time, I was concerned with my friends, not my Uncle. I deeply regretted it when he was found the next day, it has stuck with me since then. It's Christmas time again, the same time of year which was my first attempt long ago. Graduating from my teenage years was a lesser achievement I really did n't want. I made it to 20, how much more can I bare? There was n't anything here for me. I felt exhausted, empty even. I'll sleep on the thought, see what comes out in the morning... \n \n Waking up has always been a hard thing for me, so I decided to stay in bed for as long as possible. I did n't know how significant this would be to me, staying in bed. I finally got up at 3, got dressed and shoved off from home to anywhere but there. I needed to be out, because my idle head seems to get the best. Getting downtown was a simple task, I lived a mile away, so I laced my boots and headed that way. The only stores there was some old record store named Radio Kaos, the owner was an asshole and everyone thought so. Kids threw eggs at the windows a few nights ago and they froze, he's not the kind of guy who would clean it up. I walked past it heading down my normal alley route. I used to imagine they were the the catacombs in France, it was nice for a while. But at this point something felt strange about the whole day. \n \n I open my eyes and see my body in front of me, I'm slumped over holding my side. Blood. There's a lot of blood, my blood. Is this it? Was that the `` flashback'' we all heard about. Well, either way, I'm happy I'm here. Goodbye.\n"}

Gosh darn it, look what you made me do!'' \n \n `` Hon, I'm sorry. I just *ca n't take it anymore. *'' I rolled my head back and pressed my fingers to the bridge of my nose. The headaches were getting more frequent: awful, throbbing affairs that felt like a gremlin poking me behind the eyes, maliciously and repeatedly. *Is this bugging you, Petey? Is this bugging you? Is it? Is it? * `` Shut up,'' I muttered, earning myself a baleful look from Monica. ( The former Monica, who now insisted I call her by her middle name, Paige, so we could be'two P's in a pod.' ) \n \n She swiped angrily at the stain with a cocktail napkin, then rose to get some cold water from the sink, her face tight. Our apartment was small, but that had never bothered me before. Now it felt like a prison cell. Our dog, Homer – Monica had n't yet succeeded in her lobbying efforts to change his name to Persimmon, for the all-important third'P' – gave me a steady, ears-up, head-tilted look of concern. On the TV, Dwight Schrute mugged hideously for the camera and brayed `` That's the way the cookie crumbles, Jim!'' The laugh track roared. My gremlin gave me a particularly vicious jab. \n \n `` Honestly, Peter, I'm at my wit's end,'' Monica fretted from the kitchen. `` You –'' \n \n `` Stop talking like that,'' I interrupted. `` *Please* stop talking like that.'' \n \n `` Like *what*? Do n't tell me you're losing your marbles again –'' \n \n `` Monica!'' I'd hardly ever interrupted her, before. Now I could hardly ever stop myself. I ignored her glare – not for the interruption, she did n't care about that these days, but for using the `` wrong'' name – and desperately tried again. `` Do n't you remember how things used to be different? You used to be a Classics professor! You were the smartest person I've ever met!'' \n \n `` I still am a Classics professor, Peter,'' she said, using the deliberately reasonable tone I associate with kindergarten classes and hostage situations. \n \n `` No! No, you're not, *Monica*. Because *there are no more Classics*. I may not have known Ovid as well as you, but I'm fairly certain the *Metamorphoses* was n't a setup for a shaggy-dog joke, and I'm *completely fucking certain* it was n't written in *Pig Latin! *'' I was practically screaming by the end, and Monica shrank back, putting the kitchen counter between us. Suddenly I felt horrible. Whatever was going on with the world these days, it could hardly be her fault. `` And *The Office* did n't have a laugh track,'' I muttered resentfully, subsiding. \n \n `` Peter,'' she tried to soothe me, `` You're working too hard…'' \n \n It was useless. The only responses I could get out of her – or anyone – were cheesy clichés and bromides. The Earth had been thoroughly basted in Velveeta, and I was starting to doubt my own sanity. I got up and walked over to the mantel, where Monica's prized collection of Etruscan artifacts had been replaced overnight by tacky porcelain figurines. A sloppily painted and even more sloppily glazed clown gave me a vacant grin, overseen by my vintage *Star Wars* poster. Except *Star Wars*, in this universe, had apparently starred Lou Ferrigno, Christopher Lambert, and Tina Louise. I closed my eyes. Monica/Paige droned on in the background, something about a stitch in time saving nine, though the relevance of that particular saw escaped me. Michael Scott cracked up the taped audience with an incredibly depressing fart joke. `` That was a real stinker, Michael,'' I murmured. \n \n And that's when I heard it. Right on the edge of perception, like distant surf, it was – laughter? A crowd, it sounded like. It definitely had n't come from the TV, which had cut to a commercial break. *Those* still did n't have laugh tracks, were about the same as ever, in fact. I bent down and lowered the volume just in case, shushing Monica at the same time. `` It's quiet,'' I said experimentally, `` Too quiet.'' There it was again, louder this time – definitely a lot of people, laughing fit to bust a gut. `` This is a pretty pickle.'' More laughter. `` Eureka!'' *Uproarious* laughter, and I suddenly realized my headache was gone. I looked over at my wife; a smile was spreading across her face, and after a moment, I matched it with one of my own. \n \n `` I have been acting crazy, have n't I?'' She nodded slowly, now wearing a full-fledged, shit-eating grin. *Shit-eating grin, that's a good one. * `` Never mind, hon – Paige,'' I said, feeling better than I had in days. `` All's well that ends well.'' \n\n"}

Cromwell left a bottle of Absinthe and a cartoon of very handsome looking cigarettes on my desk winked at me and said: `` Do n't get too carried away son.''. Cromwell, then proceeded with his reading of a beautiful bound book with Gothic letters doing this on the floor in front of me and placing a pocket watch besides his right thigh. Then a young couple of broad smiling men entered and went straight up to my desk and greeted me in a strange accent it sounded like Scottish, but yet again I was n't completely sure. They left a very old and dusty looking statuette on my desk, with a note stating that it was from Afghanistan, but it had as resemblance to a Buddha. \n They both greeted in unison Cromwell, asked him about how things where working out, Cromwell nervously scratched his head and said and replied: `` Well I just like going on way and then back home again, but I got ta say these Jeans are amazing''. The two men both answered with a smile. Cromwell looked at his watch, the men said: `` She's on her way, there's just.'' Cromwell murmured `` traffic'', the men nodded and started to look around Cromwell and asked him about Cromwell's watch, but now in some gibberish I hardly understood. \n Minutes went by, the chatter about Cromwell's watch, I was able to figure out that the men apparently where brothers but where both called the same thing; Mr. Zimmerman, the amazing about this was that Cromwell could easily distinguish between the two of them, I could n't tell anything apart from the two of them expect their hats, one with a little hole and the other with a feather. \n The woman in question came in with hasty steps nodded surprised at the other strange people sitting in front of my desk. Left a note on my desk with a invitation to a party. \n At this point I asked what they all wanted to patent, since I had no clue what so ever to do with their gifts, and that I would n't want to know, what to do when they blocked my desk with presents. \n The woman answered: `` We all have the same interest, you just have to pick one present and then we let you to your job.'' \n \n I took a sip of my stale cup of coffee, then asking what they had to patent. The two men rose from the floor and stated `` Time-travel''. \n I looked at them smiled and said: `` Why would I ever want to travel in time?''. Cromwell sighed closed his book, put his pocket watch in his pocket, looked up at me with a tired and scruffy looking face. \n She said to the others: `` Should we try to find another date for a meeting?''. Cromwell: `` No the young man, just needs a more qualified answer. We ca n't chase a new clerk forever, we do after all have all the time, we need.''. She turned to me with a smile and said: `` Have You wanted ever to see the edge of tomorrow?'' The Zimmermans replied: `` Or ever wondered how things turn out, or have been?'' Cromwell said: `` We all want you to pick me, Zimmerman or the nice lady Mrs. Blackfrair, as the representative for a patent for a invention, we all have discovered, but we as a group ca n't choose whom will end up said patent, therefore we picked you as the only one, able to chose the final patent holder of an invention able to cross the boundaries of time.''. \n \n I was about to call for assistance, from Thomas, but his extended weekend-leave was n't over. I looked around in the room, there where only me and the three peculiar people left, the hands of the watched slowed down Cromwell was holding up to my face, I looked at the bribe they had all gathered dust suddenly, I shook my head and everything was darkend, Mrs. Blackfrair said: `` You just need to choose, it is n't harder than that.''. The office was again filled with other people even though they avoided my desk. \n I took the statuette in my hands and the Zimmermans shouted `` Veni, vidi, flati'' Cromwell and Mrs. Blackfrair appauled my decision. \n \n `` And yes, officer that is how, I ended up getting drunk of absinthe, dropping my pants and shitting on the roof your car, you know it is only Wednesday once a week.'' said yet another sot trying to defecate on my car, I still have no idea why anyone would shout `` Veni, vidi, flati. ``..\n"}

I love dragons!: D \n \n Tears streaked from the corners of Edmund ’ s eyes, the beating of Raven ’ s gargantuan wings along with her rapid descent created so much wind that he could hardly take in a breath. His legs held fast to her scaled neck, his lithe body pressed close. Horns sharp enough to impale a man protruding from the back of her skull served as his hand holds as they banked. The tips of Raven ’ s claws skimmed the water before she reared up, throwing her hind legs forward into a jolting landing onto the beach. \n \n \n Edmund clambered down onto the sand and sprawled out, enjoying the sun-heated earth and the rays beating down on him. Raven was in a similar state. He had to chuckle at how similar they had become. He wondered who she would choose to fly with her when he was dead and gone, and felt a sudden pang of sharp jealousy. Would they call her Raven? He thought back on the day he first saw her, flying high above the pastures he grew up on, circling in search of a fat calf or a grazing buck. \n \n \n He had thought she was an enormous black bird. Lower and lower she flew, Edmund frozen in fear as what he thought was a raven grew in size before his eyes into an enormous reptile, tar black scales each catching the sunlight, gleaming. She landed before him, snatching up a lamb into her jaws and engulfing it. She was regal, and terrifying. \n \n \n Her knowing eyes bored into him, considering. Edmund stood stock-still for what seemed an era, awaiting those jaws to crunch his bones. Who would harvest the grain this year? Who would cut the wood for winter? A thousand such trifles cascaded through his mind as he awaited death. The dragon took one step forward, then another. Edmund felt his soul exposed, a level of nudity he had never experienced. At last she stood before him, her reptilian stench filling all his senses, and she lowered her head. \n \n \n Fear coursed through Edmund ’ s body as his hand moved on its own accord, gliding over the intricate scaling on her brow. He felt more than heard her words. *Mine. * \n\n"}

We were about to take off and Jane's cables were in plain sight. `` They're going to notice it''. \n \n Jane and I started working out our plan a few months ago. We invited two companions to hijack this plane with us: Eric and Jerome. It was n't until a few months later that Eric and Jerome went their own way. They did n't value our motives, yet knew we had to do it. \n \n `` Here she goes'', Jane said. We felt the plane driving faster. `` This is our moment, Kane, this is the moment we can make a difference''. Our motives were simple: we had to hijack this plane to improve air security. We were fed up with all these terrorist attacks and hijacks. We had to prove it was n't going well, had to show the leaks. Even if it killed us. \n \n I got pushed back into my chair as we took off. My heart was beating faster than it ever had before. This was the day I was going to make the difference I had always wanted in life. From birth my goals was to become unforgettable. To be read about in history books. To be seen as the hero that saved countless lives. And this was the best way to do it. \n \n I had never seen Jane this happy. It was almost evil. We worked out our plan: we get up during the flight, start yelling we are hijacking the plane, make the pilot land and start communicating with the authorities afterwards. It was a solid plan. It took months of preparation. It even involved hiring a hitman to kill Eric and Jerome. If you ca n't do it one way, you got ta do it the other way. \n \n I heard some rumbling behind me. It did n't really occur to me that much that there were about 200 other people on this flight. The people right behind me seemed nervous. But I flew before, I know people get nervous. \n \n I hear the seat belt light going out. It was almost time. We said we'd do it 20 minutes after the light would go out. Time for a good drink first. I eased my mind a bit and saw the steward coming our way. \n \n `` Good morning, sir. What can I get you? ``, he asked, with a slight bitter undertone. I asked him how he was doing. Just like any kind steward he said he was alright. Yet the undertone in his voice made me feel otherwise. I asked him again, pointing out that he sounded a bit bitter. \n \n `` It's just the usual, he said. We're an hour late due to hijack threats''. I started laughing internally. He will be in for a surprise. \n \n `` I see, well, was the danger cleared? ``, I asked. `` Yes, yes sir, there is no threat right now''. It seemed like an ironic answer, cause I knew it'd be otherwise. \n \n `` EVERYBODY HANDS UP! ``, I heard from the back of the plane. I freaked out. How could this happen? Do the authorities know about us? I did n't dare look back to see who it was. \n \n `` Put your hands up or we will blow up the plane'', I heard a second voice say. The letters W, T and F were all that was left in my mind right now. A second hijack? We had n't even done ours yet. We were still 10 minutes away. \n \n `` No, you put your hands up''. The steward got up and opened his shirt. Jane freaked out. I freaked out. The steward was wearing a bomb vest and holding a wired button in his left hand. I could n't handle it for a second, this was not where I thought my day was headed. Danger by the time we landed, sure. But danger up in the air? Our plan was ruined. \n \n I could n't take it anymore, I got up. `` You! ``, I yelled at the steward. `` Come over here!''. The steward looked confused and started laughing. `` I said, come over here!'' The other passengers were looking at me like I was crazy. Maybe I was, all I knew is that I had to make the best out of our own situation, I still wanted credits for this hijack and I was n't going down in history on a passengers death list. \n \n Jane was looking at me. I nodded at her. She knew this was the signal. Jane got up and took of her shirt. Now, I know we had a lot more preparation than the steward, but Jane's vest was really, really advanced. You have to imagine a teletubby-like bomb vest including a timer, a screen and a camera. We were going to film the entire hijack. I guess all we're filming now is a terrorist stand-off. \n \n The other passengers started yelling. There was some Chinese, some Arabic, but mainly just of pile of'shits' and'fucks' flying around from every corner in the plane. \n \n A team of 5 people got up, pulling guns and threatening to kill every one of us. This was just met with lots of laughter from the other passengers. That's when I realized I was n't the only person here the hijack the plane. It seemed everybody was. \n \n I had to find a good solution. I had to get out here safely yet become a hero. I needed to get a plane, yet first it involved getting the other hijackers to give up their plans. \n \n `` I am serious'', I started yelling. `` I will kill every single one of you, be prepared to meet my gods''. There was a silence from the plane. `` Your gods? ``, someone asked. `` Yes, Jane will blow up this entire plane and take you to heaven with us.'' \n \n There was some laughter from the crowd, yet panic. It was probably the dumbest line I ever said. Yet something snapped in their brains. I completely destroyed their motives. There was no goal for them, no eternal life, no virgins, just my own made up heaven -- at least that's what I hoped they were thinking. I actually had no idea and really just needed them to calm the hell down. \n \n It somehow worked. `` If I ever have to re-tell this story I am definitely going to write a better line for that, I ca n't believe they fell for this'', I thought. I just did n't have the time now. I needed to focus. \n \n `` I will blow all of you up! ``, I repeated as I was walking to the cockpit. Jane brought a small, harmless bomb to open the cockpit door. `` Hurry up, Jane, blow that sucker out'', I frantically started yelling. I was totally into this. This was going to be my moment. \n \n A small explosion followed and the door to the cockpit was open. `` Shit! ``, I yelled as I looked at the pilot. The pilot was dead. I looked to the right, looking straight into the barrel of a gun. `` I have some bad news for you'', the co-pilot said. `` I'm hijacking this plane''. \n \n `` You've got to be kidding me'', I said. I could n't take it anymore. Something in my head just snapped and made me feel totally out of control. I grabbed the gun and his arm. `` No, you're not'', I said as I looked him straight into his eyes. `` I am hijacking this plane''. The look on his face was priceless. It was as if he saw his last glimpse of hope fly out the window and get slashed in the plane engine. \n \n I told him to land the plane. I told him to find the first airfield we could land at. And, to my very own surprise, he did. He listened. He listened very well, as if there was a gun aimed at his head. Which made sense, because at that exact moment I was aiming the gun at this head. \n \n The whole situation and the nerves just made me zone out. Jane was there with me all along, she was the one that kept me on track. `` Stay clear, Jack'', she must've said it a hundred times. \n \n It must have been 30 minutes before I really got back to my senses. We landed at the airfield and I got completely back in control. \n \n It was time to contact the authorities. I was too excited by this. This was the moment I had been living up to for months now, and it finally reached the end. I could see the finish line, I could taste the heroism that would overcome me in the next decades. \n \n I could see the news headlines already: \n `` Jack and Jane hijacked a hijacked plane''\n"}

The U.S brought the room back to order. \n \n “ So we can all agree that we want to be out of here by 3:00, right? ” asked the U.S. \n \n Everyone in the room nodded their heads in agreement. \n \n “ So that gives us about ten minutes, not counting time to eat the pizza. ” confirmed the U.S. “ Does anyone have any ideas at all who did this? ” \n \n The room went silent as everyone racked their brains. They sat in silence until everyone started to get fidgety. Russia started straightening the papers in front of him, while Nigeria chewed on the end of a pen. Finally, Spain perked up as an idea came into his head. \n \n “ Why don ’ t we just blame someone, ” he asked. \n \n The room all nodded in agreement. \n \n “ We could blame ISIL? ” proposed Jordan. ” \n \n “ That ’ s too obvious, ” returned the U.K. \n \n They all hummed and hawed as they thought of possible solutions. \n \n “ Why don ’ t we just blame it on Palestine? ” asked Jordan. “ It ’ s not like they can oppose it when we bring this to the whole delegation. ” \n \n Slowly they all agreed that Palestine would be the best scapegoat. \n \n “ All in favor of throwing Palestine under the bus? ” asked the U.S. \n \n Everyone raised their hands in agreement. Angola walked in at that moment with a box of pizza. \n \n “ Pizza ’ s here, everybody, ” he smiled. \n \n “ Where ’ s the drinks? ” asked Lithuania. \n \n “ You guys didn ’ t tell me to order any, ” frowned Angola. \n \n “ Classic Angola, ” complained China. \n \n “ I can ’ t eat this without soda, ” complained the U.S. “ Go and get us some drinks. ” \n \n “ I brought the pizza, though, ” he retorted. \n \n Everyone started to boo Angola. \n \n “ Fine, I ’ ll go and get some drinks, but you better save me a slice. ” \n \n The pizza was gone before Angola had even shut the door.\n"}

He looked on to a window propped open.He could almost hear the wind whistling through the trees; could almost smell the scent of freshly cut grass. A wry smile touched his lips as the memories of the long lazy summer days came back to him before his life had started to feel like death. He could hardly even feel the pain, it was almost.... peaceful. The world started to turn red and he wondered then, finally - what lay on the other side of the veil of darkness? Was it God, Heaven, Paradise as the priest had believed? Or was it nothingness; a darkness so deep that an eternity could be hidden from unsuspecting eyes?

The monk heard the crack of his own skull off the pavement more than felt it, and rather than the pain that he expected, warmth and numbness washed over him. His eyes twirled around in his skull but he could see the car skidding to a stop just beyond him. Glass tip-toed to the ground. He took a breath. \n \n It was a mistake. Like tossing gas on a fire, the breath pulled an unimaginable weight of agony upon him, crushing, inconsolable, bone rawness, blood ache, the breath -- a mere sip of air -- screamed from his lips back out into the world of burned rubber, smoke, coppery metallic tangy mouth feel. His head was being torn apart, cell by cell; it felt like a pair of hands were buried to his neck, prying his skull from itself, a sticky ripping wetness deep into his \n \n [ THIS SPACE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK ] \n \n Ahead stood a figure.

It wrapped around the monk, starting at the middle of his vision and expanding upwards and downwards, cloaking his vision like a retina tearing from the back of an eye. \n \n In heaven you are a steward of thoughts \n \n Thought police? \n \n It is what you make it \n \n Are there no others? \n \n Gone is the time for you to be with others \n \n But what of my fellow ascetics? \n \n There are no fellows in heaven there is only you \n \n The blackness cleared, and all was white. In the whiteness, tiny at first, a cirrus puff wafted into view. It sounded like, `` I want to kill her''. The monk swatted at it, and it dissipated. Another small, gray cloud, `` I should kill myself'', and he swatted that as well. Then there were two: `` I am worthless'' mingled with `` What is the point anyway? ``, and the tiny puffs billowed into one another into a tiny nimbus. There was a miniature crack of thunder, and the rain from this nimbus was a chorus of self denigration. The monk swatted at the nimbus, which made it rain more. He began to panic, and wished he had a towel. A towel appeared under the nimbus and soaked up the gray-blue rain, but soon it was saturated and began slowly dripping the thoughts. The monk imagined a bucket, and imagined wringing out the towel into the bucket. He envisioned the dank contents of the bucket clearing, softening, becoming white. And it all disappeared. \n \n Your training is complete \n \n On the horizon loomed a massive anvil thunderhead. The monk felt a damp, heavy breeze. The cloud approached.\n"}

They burned with the brightness of it, yes, but I would not shut my eyes to the brilliance of my childhood dreams coming true. What would I be? A fireman? A professional videogamer? A superhero? So many things I had wanted so long ago. My eyes were watering now, and tears streamed down my face. Finally, when I could take no more, I squeezed them shut. \n \n There was a great rush of air, and all was silent. Things were different. I could feel it in my bones, from my nose to my tail. \n \n I flicked open one set of eyelids, and then the other, and cast my gaze around my city. People stared at me in awe and alarm. Cell phones were slowly raised, photos and videos taken. Someone started screaming, and the crowd began to move outward, flowing away from me in terror. Police officers ran toward me or away at random, some deciding that their pay-grade just was not high enough to deal with the present situation. I ignored the officers and their guns as I spread my great wings and left the surface. The winds from my escape shattered windows and floored those who had chosen to remain. As I soared higher, I let you a great gout of flame ahead of me. \n \n I was a motherfucking dragon, and that's the way it was meant to be.\n"}

We are going to drag you in with our photon beam!'' said an alien-looking man on a screen in front of me. \n \n `` The Fermi Paradox makes this impossible! He's even speaking English, he looks human, and they are far away but have a tractor beam on us made of photons. *PHOTONS*! How is that even possible‽'' I responded with a lot of hate toward both people. \n \n They looked at me in shock, and then looked at each other. Selma nodded at the man from the `` Orgh'' race, and an alarm was set off. Selma pulled out a mic and said into it, `` Code Red has started. He knows.'' She turned to me and pulled out a megaphone. `` You're fired!'' \n \n I stared in shock at her as I walked offstage. I was too scientific to play a role in a science fiction movie, and they all knew it. Never was I able to hold back from telling people the mistakes in science they had made. `` We do have a job for you,'' the director said as I was about to walk out of the door, and handed me a laptop. \n \n `` What's this for,'' I asked, still confused. \n \n `` We need you to blog about this.

He wondered for a moment if it was code for something, like a secret menu drink. \n \n More than anything else, Eric wanted to be a good bartender. He had n't had much luck at anything else, but he knew alcohol. So he searched his mind for anything that might catch the man's interest. \n \n “ Well, there a couple of folk over there that were muttering about rounding up bandits.

I do n't much like the look of'em, but thank ye. ” His customer hopped off the stool. Eric saw that the man was only four feet tall, but had biceps the size of his head. \n \n “ Sir, did you want your drink? ” Eric asked. \n \n “ Ah, that's a good lad! ” The little man tossed back an appletini and coughed. “ By Odin's spear, that's AMAZING! ” \n \n He slammed down a coin that looked like a golden dollar, but much bigger, then strutted off to the two biker chicks. \n \n In quick succession, he redirected four other customers that had asked the same question, all equally odd. There was a man wearing a bathrobe with stars on it, a brooding girl with pointed teeth, an overly-cheerful midgit that tried to snatch his best liquor, and a woodsman with an enormous service dog. The muscle-bound dwarf beckoned him over. \n \n “ That was some mighty fine drink you gave us. I think we'll be seeing much o' each other. ” \n \n Eric's smile froze on his face as he noticed the wicked glint off a large battleaxe resting by his table.

As I speak these words to you, the crew of *Mars One* are either on the surface of Mars…or scattered in broken wreckage across the red planet. As we saw last week with Doctor Smythe ’ s “ Science Explained ” series, Mars is seven light-minutes away, and it just so happens that it takes about that long to go from space to ground. \n Which means that right now, they are either transmitting success or the radio is filled with silence….and we won ’ t know for another seven fear-filled minutes. ” \n \n “ Flightops. Confirmed Atmospheric Entry ” \n \n “ We have confirmation that the *Mars One* lander has begun entry into the Martian atmosphere. The atmosphere there is thinner than on Earth, but it ’ s still sufficient to act as a braking force. So the heat shield is currently burning up, absorbing the colossal heat that braking force generates. ” \n \n “ Flightops. Temperature within bolt range ” \n \n “ The shield has done its job, protecting the occupants from the immense plasma heat that the braking generated. This is old and proven technology, used on virtually every spacecraft. The big worry at this stage was a repeat of the *Columbia* Disaster, where a damaged heat shield caused the craft to disintegr- “ \n \n “ Flightops. Shield detach, Successful parachute deploy on one, two and three. ” \n \n “ And with that, the faithful heat shield has been explosively jettisoned. It ’ ll continue to the surface at near supersonic speeds, where a team over in Martian Geology are anticipating to acquire some seismic data. At the same time, the *Mars One* lander has deployed not one but three supersonic parachutes. Each are bigger than any parachute used on Earth – as they need to be wider to ‘ catch ’ more of Mars ’ s thinner atmosphere. ” \n \n “ Flightops. Aerobraking fins deployment confirmed on One, Two and Four. Three not responsive ” \n \n “ Aerobrake fins are now deployed, adding their efforts in shedding speed from the lander. As the old saying goes, it ’ s not the drop, it ’ s the sudden stop – and these fins are designed to slow the craft until it can use the landing thrusters. It appears that one of the fins has failed to fold out fully, but the craft is still on landing profile. A scare, but nothing more… ” \n \n “ Flightops. Thrusters Online. All thrusters responsive ” \n \n “ And the thrusters are online. Developed by our partners at SpaceX, these rockets will bring the lander to a hover about 500 meters up, and then move the craft horizontally to the support location where the Mars One expedition has already landed two unmanned capsules. ” \n \n “ Navigation: Position confirmed at 500 vert, 250 horizon. Hole in One, boys! ” \n \n “ Flightops. Beginning adjustment burn. ” \n \n “ And now they ’ ve acquired reflector beacons on those capsules, which is telling the Lander it ’ s position relative to them. They ’ re five hundred meters up and about 200 meters away from the capsules – this is incredible accuracy. As Doctor Smythe said in our segment last week, this is like hitting a golf ball in Nevada and scoring a hole-in-one on a golf course in Russia. Thousands of hours of calculations have paid off, and- “ \n \n “ Flightops! We have a manual takeover signal! ” \n \n “ Ah….um. It seems that the automatic systems have cut out aboard the lander. It ’ s operating on manual! This isn ’ t part of the flight plan. I ’ ll…Ah. Um…Apollo.

Manual burn completed. We ’ ve lost transmission due to dust. Listening for switch to localized transmission ” \n \n “ This is the moment of truth. The rocket landing has kicked up a lot of dust, and the automatic transmission channels are degraded. If the lander survived touchdown, they ’ ll need to switch to a more powerful directional transmitter to punch through. The attitude in the control room here is tense. ” \n \n “ *Mars Control, this is Minerva Base. We have successful touchdown. I repeat successful touchdown! * ” \n \n “ And there you have it, folks! The first manned spacecraft has touched down on Mars! You can see the celebrations going on around me!

He oddly enough sounds desperate so I take him up on the offer, `` Take me back to before I married''. He nodded his head and in an instant I was no longer sitting on my couch with this fellow but was standing in front of about 50 close friends and relatives, holding the hand of my soon-to-be wife. \n \n My heart was pounding, she was smiling at me, wide eyed in anticipation for the next few sentences to be spoken by the minister. I did n't think it would work, I could have wished for anything but I squandered the wish on undoing a choice that would lead me down a long, painful road of memories that bore into my soul every single day but here I was, I had the chance to undo it all! I could n't contain my grin, standing there in my Class A uniform I let out an audible sigh and she looked at me, curiously at first but then as I was looking down I felt her hands clam up, felt her heart pulsing from her fingertips, the blood draining from her cherub face. The look of fright on her face was unforgettable as I screamed `` NO''! I would be the bad guy but this choice is what I wanted. \n \n I thought back to the time, sitting in my friends chair drinking rum and listening to some loud music while she was attempting to sleep, the night that I finally ended my relationship and ties with her for good, where we fought and I almost killed her accidentally by pushing her into a door and her nearly falling down the stairs only being caught by me at the last instant before she would've tumbled down 20 narrow concrete stairs. In that moment I was no longer the quiet 19 year old that everyone in attendance had known. For what had to have felt like a lifetime to the audience I screamed in her face, releasing all the pent up sorrow, hate, and regret of things that I had suffered through in my previous life, most of which she had n't even done yet. `` You cheated on me so many fucking times, how many chances did you expect to get?'' brought about quite a few gasps among the spectators. `` You want children? How the hell do you expect us to have a child when you throw a tantrum at every little thing that I do? Nothing is ever good enough for you, we never talk about anything and the only thing that brings me any relief in this sham of a marriage is when you lay on the bed like a starfish for a few minutes while I secretly angry fuck you until I'm exhausted.'' \n \n My rage worn out, I snap back into reality and notice that she's weeping, not knowing what brought this on, what she had done wrong in the last few days to warrant this unbridled fury from what was soon to be her husband. Seeing her like this, in so much pain that she's doubled over on the floor crying I shed a single tear and start to walk to my car, my best man following suit without a word. Her family rushing to her, spitting in my face as I walk down the aisle with a smug smile on my face but none of that mattered... I was free! Free to go where I wanted, free to see the sights of my own choosing without worry of whether she would approve or not. Free to do things that a normal 19 year old was free to do. Free to be me... who was I? What did my life entail now? What was there to do after this? I could go to school like I had always told myself that I would but the only university in the state with a reputable Comp Sci course was the one that she had went to. A million thoughts whirled as I drove back to my parent's house, back to my old room that had since been vacated that same week. My phone never stopped ringing, I had received a couple hundred messages from random numbers throughout the following month all of which, having the same general message `` Come back to me'' but then one day, there was nothing. No calls, no text messages, none of her family members knocking on my parents' door. It was bliss. I later that day met up with my first high school sweetheart who had attended the wedding as well per my request and spilled my guts to her about everything that had happened and will, even of her future boyfriend that would cheat on her repeatedly until he got bored and left. She thought I was a loon, had gone off the deep end and ceased communication with me after that completely. \n \n I felt a bit of sadness creep upon me during those next few weeks but remained stoic through it all but then I received a call from my ex's mother, Amber had slit her own wrists after taking a bunch of aspirin. She screamed at me, berated me, crying with every forced word, blaming me for everything wrong in her life. I felt a deep sense of remorse, knowing that my actions had caused this girl to take her own life. The mother had done nothing wrong to me but here I was, the target of her angst and for good reason. I had killed her daughter. I wept openly around the house for the next few days, barely eating, drinking heavily and watching old cartoons until I heard a knock on the door. I stumbled up and there was that same well dressed man that I had invited into my house with his promises of a single wish.\n"}

But for my son. \n \n My wife had died several years ago and being a single parent was never really easy, but we managed. We got through when losing two jobs, moving across the country, and an emergency surgery. But at the end of it all, I was always able to make it out because I had my son ’ s support and he had mine. We were an amazing team that stuck together and we made it through it all. \n \n And for an 8 year-old kid, boy was he talented. Reading up on hyperflex drives by the time he was 6, designing his first rocket and actually launching it by the time he was 7, and now by the time he was 8, facing the extinction of the Sun. \n \n We didn ’ t know why at least no one was telling us why. We were just told, brace yourself, you have 13 hours and 8 minutes until….this planet would become a tombstone. It ’ s funny how it took millions of years for life to develop on this blasted piece of space rock, but in less than a day, all the history, all the war, every memory would be wiped out. \n \n Maybe if this happened in several hundred thousand millennia, we would have figured it out. But five hundred years after landing a man on the moon, we had barely progressed to escaping out of the solar system. \n \n But I didn ’ t care…I didn ’ t care about me. I had lived a good life, but what about my son. What about the other billions of kids on this planet who barely got a taste of life and will flicker out like a candle that was just lit. I knew one day or another, everyone would end up paying for something. I ’ d just rather be willing to give my son five more minutes for the sake of my own. \n \n “ Dad? ” a voice interrupted my thoughts. \n “ Yeah Morgan? ” I replied with a heavy heart. \n “ Don ’ t you think it sucks we ’ re gon na die before the movie comes out next week? ” he asked holding my hand. \n “ Yeah, it does, I ’ m sorry you didn ’ t even get a chance to live a full life, ” I said resting my hands on his shoulders as we watched the sky. \n “ Well, at least we ’ ll be able to see mom again, ” he smiled. \n \n “ Valid point Morgan. I think it ’ s kind of funny how you ’ re taking this. ” \n “ Well, I saw mom die when I was five, and well, I know everyone dies someday. At least I get to die with you here with me. I know Grandma died alone and Grandpa died in his sleep. At least I know that if I ’ m gon na die, I ’ m gon na die with my dad. ” \n \n “ You ’ re a smart kid Morgan, maybe you didn ’ t get a chance to change the whole world, but at least you have been able to change mine. ” \n “ In a good way? ” he gently asked. \n “ In a good way, ” I smiled. \n \n I looked at my watch as it started to beep, I had 8 minutes left with my son. \n “ Morgan? ” I asked. \n “ Yeah dad? ” \n “ Remember when I told you the difference time makes? ” \n “ Yeah it was based off that one thing about what a year meant and a week and whatever. But you made your own version…a year is, ” \n “ How long mom was in the hospital ” I replied with the clock striking seven \n “ A month is….uh how long you tried to ask out mom ” \n “ Right, ” I chuckled with six minutes. \n “ A week is….uh, how long it took us to move! ” he replied excitedly. \n “ Correct, ” five minutes \n “ A day is how long we lived in our car when we moved here ” \n I nodded with four minutes. \n “ An hour is how late… ” \n “ Grandpa was to getting to Grandma before it was too late, ” I said \n 3 minutes \n “ A minute ” he replied, “ how late you were to getting to that job interview ” \n 2 minutes. \n “ And a second is…uh….60 of them in a minute! ” He said running out of ideas. ” \n 1 minute. \n \n I smiled as I asked, “ And do you know what a lifetime is Morgan? ” \n “ What dad? ” \n A tear rolled down my face, “ 8 minutes with my son. ” \n\n"}

It is your turn to present", "human": "*You can do this, * I thought to myself as I stood up. \n \n `` Currick, John. It is your turn to present,'' said a stone-faced teacher in a lecture hall of hundreds. \n \n Everything was in slow motion as I walked toward the center of the room. \n \n 19-20th century history was the most infamous class at West-Luna University. That was mainly because the professors had decided to teach it in the style of the times. We started the semester out in a one room schoolhouse. Now we were in a gaudy looking lecture hall with hundreds of faces in it. Of course, most were holograms, but the memory chip required to be implanted to take the class made you overlook that detail. It also made you overlook the fact that everything was a completion grade. Just within the classroom, of course. Outside, the chip had no effect. \n \n *You ca n't do worse than Tim. You'll be fine. * \n \n Tim had just stuttered through a speech on early 21st century ethics. He had tried to argue that the treatment of animals and eating of meat in general was the greatest moral failing of the time. All I got out of it was something about Africa needing meat and everyone else killing pigs too slow. \n \n Horrible? Yes. Worst? No. \n \n Ashley had been unfortunate enough to be assigned men's rights. That had been comical. She probably would n't have failed in the time period though. Professors generally passed prettier students according to the holodrives I studied from. \n \n Dan absolutely nailed his speech on how women were oppressed. Unfortunately, his time period was off by about 40 years. \n \n But now it was me. \n \n I cleared my throat. \n \n `` During the–*cough cough*–during the early 20th century, a major failing of society was the idea of equality.'' \n \n I was greeted by silence. \n \n `` People,'' I said again, confidence returning to my voice, `` are not equal. They do n't have the same skills, they do n't have the same strength, the do n't have the same knowledge. Even the science at the time showed genetics played a huge part in what one was good at. The entire idea of equality was one of selfishness and one of coddling.'' \n \n I paused. The professor had a smirk on his lips. \n \n `` For because of this, disappointment and pride were conditioned from birth to be perfectly normal, acceptable vices,'' I said, losing my place on the paper. I had stayed up too late studying for this last night. \n \n `` Why was this even considered true? The president of one of their countries and a homeless man do not have the same value. If they had to choose one to die, people would not have hesitated in their choice. Now some would argue that the homeless man may have been loved by someone, giving him greater value in an emotional sense. However, they fail to see that people loved the president too. The presidents at the time all had families. Was their love less real because of luxury?'' \n \n I let it sink in. The professor was actually smiling now. \n \n `` In early America, during the 17 and 1800s, it was partly a religious concept: that all men were created equal and were equal in their unworthiness of salvation. Now this can be argued, but not proved. And by the 21st century, the society had very much separated their government and their religion. Yet their government still heavily supported this odd ideal of equality.'' \n \n The professor cut me off at this point, `` Excellent! Excellent, John!'' \n \n Sweet relief trickled down my spine. \n \n `` It's too bad I have to fail you!'' \n \n Lightning struck my stomach as I nearly fainted from the thought. What would I do if I failed out of college? College was the only option! \n \n `` W-why, sir?'' I stuttered out. \n \n `` Because I disagree with you,'' he said, `` In fact, you all fail because I disagree with all of you!'' \n \n Murmurs and screams of panic spread throughout the lecture hall until the teacher turned the memory chips off and we realized it was just a completion grade. I wiped the sweat from my forehead and smiled ruefully and our teacher. \n \n `` This,'' he said, `` is the greatest moral failing of the early 21st century; an opinion could not be enjoyed or evaluated fairly apart from your own. It is the idea that you are always right and doubt is a weakness instead of a strength. Despite some religions even teaching doubt to be a tool of strengthening at the time, society as a whole viewed life in 2 dimensions: wrong and right. Of course, my opinion probably has some bias in it, since I am an educator and that area suffered the most because of this moral failing. Therefore, I invite you all to make your own conclusions in the spirit of correcting past mistakes!'' \n \n And with that, the hologram of fake students vanished. The other three real students, the professor, and I left the room for lunch.\n"}

The world has been a kaleidescope of colour ever since my eyes had been opened. \n \n It happened overnight. I did n't notice anything at first. I went about my usual morning routine of taking a piss and washing up. It was only after walking into the kitchen that I realised something was different. My mom's shadow. It was green. Hulk green. \n \n I rubbed my eyes, trying to get rid of the sleep. `` Mom, your shadow.'' I said. She smiled, slightly unconcerned, bringing over a plate of bacon and eggs for me. `` Yes honey? What's the matter?'' \n \n `` It's green.'' I said, taking the plate from her while sitting down. I needed the chair, my knees felt weak. \n \n `` Do n't be silly honey, shadows are black. I think someone needs more eggies to wakey! Eat up! You'll be late for school.'' She said cheerily, ruffling my unruly hair before leaving the kitchen. \n \n `` But it's true.'' I mumbled softly to myself. My mind raced furiously as I shoveled food into my mouth. I gave myself a once over, it seemed like everything was normal. I needed more people. I needed to check. \n \n Putting my plate into the sink, I walked into the living room to grab my bag. `` I'm leaving for school mom!'' I yelled. `` Enjoy the day honey!'' She said from upstairs before I closed the door and headed out. \n \n It was an explosion of colour. I saw businessmen stride by with shadows bathed in grey and red. Young ladies in bubblegum pink. Young children with shadows that held a swirl of colours that kept shifting around, almost as if they could n't decide what colour to be. \n \n `` Whoa...'' my jaw dropped in surprise as I took in the myriad of colours that passed me by. There were colours beyond imagination, colours that I could n't name. \n \n It was only after school that I figured out what I was looking at. Souls. My theory was that people were prisms and when light passed through us, the light showed our souls. Maybe we could had seen them all along just that we forgot but somehow, I've managed to reawaken that ability. \n \n That explained why Tim was fiery red tinged with blue, a rash bully that hid a fearful interior. Why mum was a vivid green, a young lady who was nurturing and kind, trying to do right by her son. \n \n It was such a pleasure to walk through the streets. Everywhere I turned, pleasant colours entered my view. However, something was nagging on my mind. Something about this morning. My face scrunched up as I searched through my mind to figure out what was so disturbing.That's when it hit me. As I turned back to look at my feet, I could feel chills running up my spine. Standing out in stark contrast to the colours ran me by, was the raven black of my shadow, of my soul.\n"}

He was grinning back at me. \n \n `` Do n't call me *that*,'' he responded back. Our old argument. He sat down on the bench next to me. There were trees around the area, but their leaves were covered in snow, and ice. Dead world. \n \n `` I like the bench,'' Evaad said to me. `` If it stood up to the death of the entire world, you know? Must be special...'' \n \n I did n't reply. \n \n `` C'mon, Auryn. You ca n't keep coming back here. There really is n't anything else to do. We've tried, for years now. The planet is dead and gone. And when you come back here, you bring the snow with you. It ca n't be good for... whatever grows here. Does anything grow?'' \n \n `` Uh... I do n't know. I wandered around for a few weeks, but only found some old trees. They might still be alive...'' \n \n Doctor Evaad pulled off the pack he was wearing, and started to rummage through. `` Auryn, I made these gauntlets for you. You remember? They work. I mean, feel my hands right now. You ca n't feel much heat coming off them, can you?'' \n \n I touched Evaad's hands, and they were a normal temperature. Typically, they felt like getting close to lava. I took the gauntlets he handed me, and slipped my arms into them. After only a minute, the snow had stopped coming down on the old, dead world. \n \n `` Still a bit heavy, Evaad.'' I ribbed him. \n \n He laughed, in reply. He started to rummage around his pack, again, and pulled out a small, red stone. He flicked his wrist, and the stone became the top of a cane. He used the cane to pull himself up. The snow around the bench started to steam as soon as he put both boots near the snow. I got up, too. I breathed in heavily, but somehow, felt less sad. Less helpless. \n \n `` What should we use, My Liege?'' \n \n I rolled my eyes and looked around. There was a small stone building, which had mostly toppled over. A single wall still stood. It was tall enough. I pointed toward it, and Evaad smiled in return. \n \n Evaad walked over to the wall, and pulled the stone off his cane. He muttered some words which I could never *quite* hear, and the stone started to glow. He pressed the stone into the wall, and there was a small pop. He turned the stone, and pulled. The *wall itself* opened, as if it had been a door all along. The `` inside'' of the wall was our little airship. There was a fire burning in the corner, and a small feast had been prepared for us. Several adventurers, people we'd known for years, were waiting. They smiled at me, and I smiled back. \n \n I motioned for Evaad to go first, as was our custom. And in reply, he motioned for me to go next. So I did. Evaad started to close the door. Unseen, as he shut the wall, his red jewel fell to the ground, and disappeared. It reappeared on top of his cane a moment later. \n \n I sat at the front of the table, and looked around the dinner table. On the far left, a tall man, with a beard, and a very large Halberd slung across his back smiled in return. On the right, were two adventuring siblings, whom I hadn ’ t seen in some time. Right on my left, a beautiful woman I fancied smiled broadly at me, her golden hair falling in front of her eyes. Evaad sat at the opposite end. There was but a moment of waiting. And, then, we began to feast.\n"}

I do n't usually take to cuss words well, I hate it when people swears. My mother taught me not to, and growing up it always feel unnatural when I try to. And when on the receiving end, I feel like it hits me more than it would anyone. My mother was fond of Frederick. \n \n \n `` lol. I do n't know man, I do n't feel like it lately.'' \n `` Hm.'' \n `` Ca n't get into it, you know, without my spotter.'' \n `` Guys there wont spot for ya?'' His responses are perfect, but lightning quick, I thought he could n't type this fast. \n `` They would, but, I do n't know man, it's not the same.'' \n `` Oh come on, dude, you're making excuses. Excuses do n't build muscles.'' \n `` hahaha, you remember when I tried the 30 kilos.'' \n `` haha! How can I forget, you only managed four reps then you tried putting it down on your knees but you went flying forwards. Almost crashing into the mirror. I still have the video on here.'' \n `` hilarious shit, dude. Good thing you were there to catch me.'' \n \n \n He responded with a colon and a closing bracket. He's the kind of guy who omits the dash. \n \n \n `` I miss you man.'' I felt stupid writing that. \n `` You faggot.'' He continued after a line-break not more than a second later `` I miss you too buddy.'' \n \n \n I stopped and smiled at the screen for a while. Seconds later Frederick sent another message. \n \n \n `` Btw, dude, if you've run out of them protein shakes, you should check out the RipJuice 3k. They do em damn tasty. Does n't cost much. You should check it out at http: //www.ripjuice3k.com/'' \n \n \n Friendly as he still seemed, that last entry wiped the smile clean off my face. Not the message, but the little faded italicized text next to it; it says *SPONSORED*.\n"}

Not that there ’ s anything wrong with that, she just born that way. The first witch from a muggle family. I still remember the day she brought me to this Diagon Alley, I could not believe nor understand two thirds of what was going on, she laugh and laugh at my dropped jaw and pushed me inside this toy store on a corner. There a red hair man was telling a joke and kids around him where clapping. \n \n `` That's George Weasley,'' she said, `` I told you about him already.'' and she had, that secret war that run about 20 years ago, she was a little kid back then not even having received her acceptance letter. But now she was a witch, a proper witch, and I am her husband, which is nice, do n't get me wrong, but its so weird. Specially at the store. \n \n I bought the store 3 years ago, as I'm a veterinarian I though I could do it, I mean, I just have to sell kids pets, how complicated could that be? oh... boy... you have no idea. I do n't know why, but beast behave different around wizardry people, I employ a kid that just got out of `` hag warts''! he, if Amanda hears it she'll kill me, anyway, this kid can talk to spiders and they do whatever he wants, I have to be wary of him asking them to build nets in the door frames and not eat them every time i go by, but I could not expect less of a Weasley I guess. \n \n And then the frogs, did you know you can buy a potion that will send frogs to sleep? and that you can buy them by barrel because they wont stop singing if you do n't?

Or when the house elfs came by and ordered and cleaned the store, what's with that, they didn ’ t even asked for anything and where just happy and chapping all the time, I almost shat my pants the first time. \n \n Just the other day there was an old woman who wanted me to find her a vulture bird because she needed a hunting companion... luckily my lovely wife told her that that was illegal both on the muggle and the wizardry worlds. \n \n But what weird me the most are all those cages my wife and our employee handle all day, those that seem to have nothing inside, they give me the chills. \n \n Luckily I ’ ve made some friends with the locals, specially this incredible huge guy who hangs at the bar frequently, he is always interested on hearing me talk about normal everyday animals, and then he talks and talks about things i can hardly believe, dragons and mermaids, nargles and hypogriphs. \n \n I love my wife and the world she lives in, and i love that i can see at least part of it, but some nights i ca n't sleep thinking about those empty cages, and what if my wife and myself are not seeing even weirder things out there. \n \n \n =========== \n I'm not good at English: (\n"}

Apologies in advanced! \n \n _______________________________________________________ \n \n Anonymous Tactile Medium. ATM for short. That's how most people pay for things, ever since the 6th economic crash this century. They were a physical private key into the world of cryptocurrency. A huge blockchain network and the lack of central servers renders falsifying transactions nearly impossible. \n \n Nearly. \n \n I do n't know who made it, or why they made it, or how, but there's a website. It claims to give you exactly enough money to get through the day. Most of the population think it's a scam. In fact, I did too, until drunken me signed up for it. Apparently it `` chose'' me, according to that email. Not sure if that means I'm the only one it works for, or if it really is a scam. \n \n Well, I guess I know it's not a scam now. I drained currency off my primary chip onto my secondary one. Then I connected my primary chip to the website. It did n't matter if it took control of my chip or whatever, I could have just gotten a new one implanted into my hand. It was something like a five minute procedure to get an old chip removed and a new one installed. \n \n But I'm going off topic here, I'm sure you know all of this. The part you probably do n't know is that... the website worked. For months now, I've had the money beamed into my account from who knows where. No matter where I decide to go for lunch, or who decides to mess with my plans, I always have enough money for the day. I do n't even have to work around the amount, it just sort of... happens to cover everything. It's not like I've got this huge amount in it and the extra is taken out. No, it is exactly how much I'm going to spend that day. Most days, it's only a few dozen dollars, sometimes less. Every once in awhile it will be a few hundred. Kind of spoils when I'm about to go on a date, ya'know? At least, in those rare cases I go out on a spontaneous date with people. \n \n But now I'm getting sidetracked again. I guess I should tell you of where the story _really_ gets interesting: the day I found 70,000,000 in my chip. \n \n It felt... weird. I'd gotten into the habit of looking at how much I had each morning, and guessing what I would be doing. That day, however... I did n't know. It was hard to leave bed, knowing that I had more money than all the money I'd ever possessed before that point put together. \n \n It was on the train to work that I found out _why_. The man looked suspicious. He kept glancing into his duffel bag, then checking his watch. Bag. Watch. Bag. Watch. Phone. Next stop sign. Bag. Watch. \n \n We were about halfway down the line, and the train driver was clocking out, someone else getting on to replace them. It was then when the suspicious jumped off his seat, drew a large gun from the duffel bag, and told everyone to get down. One person, a woman, probably an undercover cop, jumped up from her seat, but was quickly shot down by a second man holding a much smaller gun. \n \n `` THIS TRAIN IS OURS NOW! Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt. Think of your families. On your knees, heads to the ground, arms behind your backs. If you've got heart problems, take a seat, keep your arms outstretched. I do n't want to see anyone going for their phones. Glasses too! Throw your glasses and phones here, NOW! I do n't care if they're prescription, you do n't need them with your SHUT EYES!'' \n \n With that, the man with the hand gun, the one who had shot the woman, walked to the front of the train, dragging the conductor in with them. They got the train moving, stopping it partway to the next stop. \n \n It was then that I realized what I had the money for. \n \n `` The city is supposed to be wiring 50 mil to one of you guys' accounts. You're free to go once you get it. You see this phone in my hand? I'm in call with your fucking _guardian angel_ right now. Everybody tell him thanks.'' \n \n The car remained silent, prompting the man with the very large gun to raise it up. `` I SAID TELL HIM YOUR THANKS, YOU UNGRATEFUL MAGGOTS!'' His words reverberated through the car, alongside the sounds of metal puncturing metal as several bullets went through the roof of the train. \n \n Amidst the sounds of panic were several yelled thank yous. \n \n `` Good. Now. I want to make it clear to you dirty, bureaucratic dog. If I've not got my money in 30 minutes, I start killing one person every minute. I see so much as a GLINT in these tunnels, I blow the top off this car, taking everyone with me.'' \n \n The man looked around the car, until his eyes finally landed on me. `` YOU! Come. MOVE YOUR ASS!'' He looked back to his phone. `` I've got someone here. Name's...'' I stared blankly at him. `` TELL ME YOUR NAME!'' \n \n I stammered it out as firmly as I could. \n \n `` There. That's the name. You get that? You've got 30 minutes to get him the 50 mil, or he's dead.'' \n \n `` Sir, 30 minutes just is n't eno...'' \n \n `` SHUT IT! 30 minutes.'' He hung up the phone. \n \n _________________________________________________________ \n \n Perhaps you can guess what happened thirty minutes later. We shook hands, me and the gun toting maniac. He activated a transfer device, and choose the amount, 50 million. He was pleasantly surprised when it went through. We were all told to get off the train, one by one, as the two men detached the first car from the rest of the train. They drove off, leaving us behind. SWAT was soon surrounding us, making sure we were all ok. We were ferried to the nearest stop, where ambulances and reporters waited in the wings. Of course, I was the first target. \n \n But not by the media. No, it was police marshals. They had n't been able to transfer the money to me, in part due to having never registered my public token with the state. Not registering my token was perfectly legal, they were n't here about that. \n \n They wanted to know how a minimum wage employee working at a fast food joint, barely out of college, had 50 million in their account. I was soon detained, but due to an old, nearly forgotten law that my ( way too expensive ) lawyer found, bail was set at 10 million. Of course, I simply paid it. I was out in no time. \n \n Next came figuring out where to go. Tom knew some shady contacts, and I knew one of them. So I went, spending a few thousand here, tens of thousands there, until I finally got to the real deal. 1 million to completely change my identity. New country, new name, new papers. Everything I needed, travel included. By the end of it all, I had just over a dollar. Enough for one last meal at the restaurant I hated.\n"}

Mortal men fight alongside the Goblins of Einhower, the Orcs of Grimwall and even the White Wolves of Mursul'duk have came to support the fight. The Ents of Finsark Forrest emerge from the treeline and walk among the fleets of fighters, all marching towards one specific point. Deaths peak. \n \n \n \n Deaths peak was were the enemy resides. The closest point to the heavens that can be reached from the ground. It is there, that 5 silhouettes stand tall. The Gods of Varshuth. \n \n \n \n The march drew to a halt. One Human, armoured with a gleaming plate set with a gold eagle beautifully crafted to his chest plate, stood forward and turned to see the hoard behind him. \n \n \n \n `` Men, Orcs, Goblins, Ents and all other species, listen to me now. We have marched far and wide, united when most said it would be impossible. Unified when all hope seemed lost. Those Gods up on that mountain top have threatened our world that we live in, and the very fabric of life we hold dear. We will stand unbroken. We will fight unwithered. We will prevail!'' \n \n \n \n As the leading man finished his sentence, members of the hoard pointed upwards, towards the beings on the mountain top. All but one leaped off, now mid-air, falling towards the ground below. Forming craters where they land, all four of them stood up tall, before the army that has amassed at their doorstep. \n \n \n \n `` Mere mortals, you believe to have the power to destroy us?'' One of the God like beings roared before turning its head towards another of the beings. \n \n \n \n The 20ft tall humanoid creature lifted one arm out in front of it's body, opened it's hand and with a flash of light, a large rod extended in its palm, creating a staff far greater than any had ever seen. The God stepped forward before gently placing the tip of the staff on the floor and started chanting. Purple smoke was emitting from the base of the rod and the ground began to crack. \n \n \n \n Bewilderment struck the leading Humans face as he turned to his army and ordered for the all out attack. \n \n `` Fire the arrows!'' He screamed as the sky blackened with a river of ammunition. `` March onward!'' \n \n A roar from all Earths warriors shook the mountains. The beings were outnumbered 500:1 yet they did n't seem phased. Nothing the mortals could throw at them would cause much damage. The human leader shouted order after order as he watched the factions he had rallied perish faster than he could count. The destruction was uncontrollable. No more than 2 hours of battle had passed before there were only a handful of fighters left. Exhausted, aching and defeated, the remaining fighters dropped their weaponry and fell to their knees. All but one. \n \n The Human leader looked at the Gods; Not a mark on them. They were too strong. He readied his sword one last time as he looked at the piles of bodies that had formed. The God stared at him. \n \n `` You truly have the heart of a warrior.'' The being said to the Human before grabbing him by the waist. \n `` You shall see the world through our eyes.'' \n The God cocked his arm back, and threw the Human in the air with more force than was ever previously witnessed by man. The Being still stood atop the mountain reached out and grabbed the man, placing him on the ridge of the rocky ground, and told him to see the world through their eyes. \n \n \n \n The Human sat there, looking at the destruction that was left down below. For hours he sat, in silence, looking at the ground before him before finally, he spoke. \n \n \n `` I have been sitting, waiting on the edge of the world, waiting for you to tell the truth to me...'' \n \n `` Go on.'' \n \n `` Did we create this massacre?'' The human followed on to say. \n \n `` You did, the moment you declared war on the first settlement on earth. Humans love destruction. Humans love war and with that fact, Humans must be eradicated from Earth in order for other species to flourish.'' \n \n `` What of the Orcs and Goblins?'' \n \n `` They are of a peaceful species, they only defend what is theirs from Humans.'' \n \n `` But they fought along side Humans until their end?'' \n \n `` They did what they thought was right, to help another living creature. Not for wealth or honour, but to aid.'' \n \n The remaining Human looked at the God and asked one final question. \n \n `` What of me now?'' \n \n `` You know.'' \n \n \n \n The human looked far into the distance, ice forming around his beard. The cold chill welcoming. He bowed his head as the being reached out his hand and placed his finger on the mans back. \n \n `` Now peace.''\n"}

After being cut loose by The Times in an'organizational restructuring,' and despite being given a rather generous severance package, I had slipped into a deep bout of depression and found meek solace in the bottom of the bottle. The severance pay was running out, and quickly, and I had squandered most of my remaining money on overpriced take-out Chinese food and bottles of rock-gut vodka. Rent was due, and there was no way I could afford my trendy Upper West Side apartment. \n \n This all weighed down on me, heavily. The lack of money, the rattling hangovers and the general overwhelming sense of failure. I knew when The Times handed me my walking papers, it was n't my fault. It was just a bad shake, as my dad would have pointedly said. It still weighed down on me. \n \n This particular morning, like many others, my head was pounding painfully in rhythm with the annoying buzz of my alarm clock. Each chirp, another explosion of pain and a sharp reminder that God's clear liquid never rewarded those that overindulged. Eventually, I mustered the energy to turn off the alarm clock and meander weakly to my living room. \n \n I fell hard onto the couch, the moment of impact causing my stomach to revolt in anger for my arrogance. As my eyes slowly refocused to the bright light of the mid-morning, they located a small white envelope resting on my coffee table. I had n't placed it there, and had little idea where it came from. My initial thought was that my landlord had snuck into my apartment last night, having preemptive knowledge of my severance running out, with a notice to evict. \n \n My heart stopped. \n \n I reached anxiously out to the envelope, flipped it over and aggressively ripped open the back of it. A Turkish Airlines boarding pass, my passport and a small note fell into my lap. \n \n I cautiously picked up the note, and in small hurried cursive it read: Come, David. \n \n I picked up the boarding pass and flipped it open, searching for the final destination -- it was a flight from New York City, to Instanbul, with the final connection landing in Kinshasha, Congo. The flight left in 10-hours. \n \n Kinshasa? \n \n My mind raced. I had done work with the Peace Corps in Johannesburg, but had heard little about the DRC, and even less about Kinshasa during my time there. I had met a farmer who claimed to be from the DRC, when I inquired about what it was like, he gravely responded with,'it's a world filled with people who believe they're living in hell, more evil and desperate than anywhere imaginable.' My mind continued racing. \n \n Who was this? Who was able to steal my passport from my safety deposit box? Who is calling me to the Congo? \n \n I said'Kinshasa' aloud, and the name rolled smoothly off my tongue like an expensive wine. There was something undeniably tantalizing about it. I proceed to say,'Kinshasa, Congo.' The words together were ravenous. There was something so exotic, primal and mysterious about the names together. A word so fluid like Kinshasa mixed with the ruthlessness of the word Congo lit up in my mind like an elaborate painting. \n \n I did n't know anything about Kinshasa, or the Congo, other than what that farmer had said. I did n't know who was beckoning me to this place. But somewhere, deep down, there was an instinctual drive pushing me towards it. As if this was where I could reinvent my life, leave New York City behind, leave the Times behind. I could salvage and abandon my train-wreck of a life by leaving it all behind. This was my chance. \n \n I could be in Kinsahsa, Congo in a little over a day. \n \n I raced to pack my bags.\n"}

These malfunctions are caused by an ancient invisible species known as the gremlin. They have caused things to go wrong since the beginning of recorded history. They feed on strong negative emotions of human beings, so they break our mechanical devices when we are n't looking. \n \n Many centuries ago, there was a king whose kingdom was known far and wide for the textiles. Their beautiful silks and their gorgeous cashmere was sought after far and wide. These wonderful fabrics were created with a machine made by a mage for his king, it was an advanced piece of machinery that produced non-stop. \n \n One day a gremlin entered the castle on the axle of a wooden cart. the wheel of the cart was broken because of the gremlin, and when the wheel was replaced it would be a while before the gremlin could break it again. A wicked smile crossed the gremlin's face as he looked at the machine. \n \n BAM! BOOM! the machine grinded to a halt as the gremlin broke an axle. The mage asked the king `` shall i repair the damaged axle?'' but the king got furious and told him not to touch it `` the rest of the machine still works, do not fix it!'' and the mage did not. \n \n Many days later the gremlin grew bored and decided to take out another axle. BAM BOOM! another of the fine looms grinded to a halt. the mage came to the king `` i can fix this very quickly sire, both looms can be working again by today'' but the king huffed `` No, we can not stop production, even for a minute. we will just have to run the two remaining looms at twice the speed'' and the mage did so. \n \n The gremlin loved the havoc he was causing, the fast spinning machinery was too much to resist. The gremlin pressed his accursed finger to the axle of both looms and they both broke with an ear shattering snap! The whole machine stops, and the loom is dead quiet. \n \n The mage comes to the king `` the loom has completely broken down! I can fix it sire but it will take me hours!'' The king looks down upon the mage `` It's your machine that broke, it's your fault that this kingdom can not create any textiles. You must be punished, to the dungeon!'' \n \n The mage sits in the dungeon, the city starts to lose money. after a few days food starts to become scarce as the town traded textile for it's food. The king growls about how the horrible mage has doomed the city and threatens anyone who suggests releasing the mage or comes up with a strategy for repairing the loom. Things get more dire as even the king can not find food. \n \n A few weeks later the king has a change of heart, and asks for the mage. The mage, starved and filthy stands before the king `` how.. may i serve you my king?'' \n \n `` mage, i am a fool. My people are starving and we have nothing to trade. If you can fix the looms, i will set you free and make you my thane and promise that in the future i will hear you out'' \n \n The mage nods `` I can fix them sire, i will require a shimmerwood log and nails made by the smith in the next town'' \n \n The king looks aghast `` i spent all the money trying to acquire food for my people, i barely have the money to give you what you need. Can we not use oak from the nearby wood and nails made by my personal blacksmith?'' \n \n The mage shakes his head solemnly `` shimmerwood is the only wood that can take the pressure, and only the smith a town over knows how to make nails that will hold.'' \n \n The king sighs `` i will get you the materials you require, you may rest until they arrive.'' \n \n A few days later, the loom is running at full speed. textiles that are being made are as sought after as ever. The mage shuts down the loom and checks it every night for signs of gremlins. He tough his sons and their sons after them. \n \n So when gremilns break your favorite thing, stay calm and maybe you can fix it. Some things can keep gremlins away, we call it `` maintenance'' which mean `` main tenants'' referring to the mages family who stayed near the loom to look after it's care. \n \n But the main thing is to hold in your anger and listen to those who are trying to help you. Their are many `` mages'' in this world who spend their lives learning how to fix things. They can help you after the gremlins attack, treat them with care. Their advice can prevent you from losing money, and respect.\n"}

With his back to the ledge, John leaned carefully, trying to keep his balance while the blur of cars below flowed and shimmered in the moonless night, a restless city. In his right hand he held a half-eaten carrot tightly by its green leaf. \n \n `` It's all I have anymore. My choice,'' he shouted back. The carrot dangled precariously in his hands. Rain collected where the carrot had been chewed, dripping occasionally. Mary's eyes were fixed on the drops of water. `` I found my son dead this morning,'' cried John, `` and you were there the whole time, you should have seen him, and saved him, but you did n't because you were busy fucking the neighbor in the bedroom.'' He paused and wiped the wetness from his face. `` I do n't — I do n't what I did wrong to have Tim die or you go for Lenny. I do n't even care right now, you can have it all, all of Lenny and the house and—and... all of it, just, I want to see how he died, how my son, so young and so innocent died on a school morning, at home. I should have been there.'' He was breathing heavily now, weighed down with pain, suffering, loss, and confusion that begged, screamed for an answer. \n \n Mary stepped forward, `` P-please, John, come down, throw the carrot. You do n't need to know. Please.'' Her arms were outreached to John, trying to embrace him at the ledge. `` Let it go, we can deal with this.'' John looked down to the cars, then back to Mary, then at the cars again. \n \n `` No,'' he said and ate the carrot. He chewed methodically with his eyes closed. Tears began flowing down his cheeks, marked in long streaks where rain would n't fall. And he began shaking and Mary grabbed hold of him and embraced him with her arms. \n \n `` Please come down,'' Mary said, `` I'm so sorry.'' John lay his face on the top of Mary's head and screamed, the tears gushing, he overcome by what he had seen, had taken in when he had eaten. \n \n `` You saw him, you saw him!'' he cried. `` His head was down and you saw him and you walked passed!'' \n \n `` I'm sorry, I am so sorry.'' Mary burst into tears, `` I—I was... I do n't know, oh Tim, oh God!'' They both collapsed, she falling onto her knees and John into her lap, his arm dangling over the edge, holding the last green leaves of the carrot Tim had been chewing at the time of his death. John's hand released the leaves and they fell, spinning, floating downwards, a sharp silhouette framed by dark streaks of rain and glinting car lights in the sleepless city far below. \n \n -004\n"}

I've been labeled an `` Unbeliever'' ever since I outright rejected the idea, but that was before the whole world turned to it. Naturally they also turned on me.

As soon as I saw his face, I instantly recognized him. The look on his face was the exact same that night he killed my wife and only child. It was the look of despair. \n \n You might be wondering why I did n't give the cops an accurate description so that this bastard would have been caught. It's a simple answer. It's because I've known this man all my life. Of course I would know who he is because he's my older brother. When he stormed into my house that night, I was sleeping on the couch. I was jolted awake by the sudden loud noise. Luckily I left the lights on so I saw his face. He paled when he saw mine. `` Dear god, I prayed it was n't going to be your house.'' I did n't understand what he meant. At least not at the moment. \n \n Me and my older brother Thomas had never been close. He left home with mom right after high school and I have n't seen him or my mother since. It came to a bit of a shock when he appeared in my house that night with a shotgun in his hands. `` What the hells wrong with you?'' I yelled at him. Not because he had just broken down my door, but because of all the time that had passed. Not one phone call or birthday card. He did n't even show up to my wedding which was a few years back. \n \n His eyes turned red as if he was about to tear up. He shook his head and pushed me out the way. `` I'm sorry, Tim, but I have to do this.'' He stormed into seven year old daughters room and shot her dead in her bed. Not one time, not two times, but at least six times. I stood horrified as I watched my daughter die. My wife stormed out of our room and screamed. I did n't hesitate as Thomas turned the gun on her. I grabbed Thomas gun making him miss the shot at my wife. `` You crazy motherfucker!'' I cried out as a punched him square in his mouth. He stumbled back, but not very far. I was not the athletic child. \n \n `` Get out of the way!'' He yelled back at me, brandishing a long knife from the inside of his coat jacket. He pushed me aside and turned back towards my wife. Maybe it was just the height of the moment or maybe I did n't want to see, but the woman who Thomas had charged was n't my wife. This thing was something else entirely. It was not human. Not even close. I wo n't go into details because truthfully this a memory I'd much rather forget. \n \n As I said I ran into my brother again. His eyes were horrified to see me. He tried to break loose of my tight grip and probably run. He probably thought I was angry. I was n't angry to see him, but I was n't really happy either. I smiled as pulled him into a hug. He was never big on physical contact, but at that moment I did n't care. I do n't know why I did it, but I just gave him my phone number and told him my new address before leaving. I did n't look back. No. I could n't look back. He was my brother and I loved him. He needed me a lot more than I realized, because any man who has the courage to leave his own family fight the monsters and demons who lurk their way into other people lives needs to have someone there to help.\n"}

Look, we can work this out!'' \n \n As the sword was raised, gun fire opened up. Human gun fire. The Sangheili, knowing of the presence of the Demon on Requiem, ordered the Phantom to fly away with the *TARDIS* on board. The warrior ordered his men to find him, amd as soon as they turned around, his guards and men were blasted by a rocket. The Unggoy, in fear, looked for the Demon. But when they found him, his green suit was the last thing they saw as the Master Chief opened fire at them. The jackals, in a phalanx formation, fired their pistols and needlers but the Chief was too swift. He'd flung a grenade and killed them off. In all the chaos, the Doctor used his sonic screw driver to disable the warrior's shields. As the warrior roared in anger over his shields, the Chief took the opportunity to stab a knife into its shoulder, then proceed to knock it onto the ground, dead. \n \n As he helped him up, the Chief was confused on seeing another human on Requiem. \n \n `` My *TARDIS*... It's gone.'' \n \n `` Your what?'' \n \n `` My *TARDIS*. The Covenant took it. They saw me dematerialize in front of them and now they have it. If they find out how to use'er they'll end humanity.

The Doctor repaired her. \n \n `` Now, no time to waste'' said the Doctor as he handed Cortana back. He grabbed a Storm Rifle and pocketed two plasma grenades. \n \n `` I'm not too rusty back from my days of war.'' \n \n `` Let's go'' said he as the Chief and the Doctor ran towards the area the Phantom flew towards. `` I'll explain everything as we go.'' \n \n\n"}

You spend your days and nights running wild all of the globe, constantly worn thin between a thousand different contracts, and all you can think about is taking a rest. Hell, I ’ ll be the first to tell you that a vacation every now and then is great, I used to love taking a week off in a city I ’ d already been to countless times and just being a person. Do you know the first time I went to the top of the Empire State Building was the third time I had been in the building? Yeah, no kidding, the first two were for work and I couldn ’ t just hang around all day waiting to get caught. It was nice to take a little vacation here and there to just be a person. \n \n For the longest time I thought of retirement as just one big long vacation at the end of my job. In a way, I guess it was but let ’ s be realistic here all good things have a limit. I went from being high strung for months or years on end to just not having to worry about anything at all *forever. * \n \n Don ’ t get me wrong, I don ’ t mean to complain too much, it did get better. At first though it sucked. You see, I promised that I would never take a contract again. I had a lot of money saved up and a lot of free time but nowhere to really go. So at first, I traveled, a lot. I spent a year seeing the world, taking the kind of trip some people take when the graduated high school back in my day ( or after college these days, I guess kids wait a little longer ). \n \n I ’ m droning on, I ’ m sorry for that, it ’ s just that I spent so long not being able to tell anyone about anything, now I kind of just start talking and it all gets away from me. The short and long of it is, after more than two years of meandering through life without a job I realized I need to find purpose or I was going to lose my mind. So I stared honing some skills. I trained in Martial Arts for a while and even took yoga, I already speak three languages but I never could bring myself to lean a new one, it seemed unnecessary and it felt like work ( obviously I spent a lot of time “ studying ” as a hitman and it was far and away the shittiest part of it all ). I know it is too late to make a long story short but let me jump ahead and tell you that I need to be on my feet and working with my hands so I opened a wood shop and make high-end ( ish ) furniture. It started as an experiment, I just wanted to make a nice bedside table with a secret compartment in it. Of course I have a lot of time and resources and an addictive personality so I wound up with a garage full of tools and a house full of new ( if not nice ) furniture. \n \n Anyway, one morning I was having my coffee on my porch, like I do on any sunny day, before heading to my shop. I open the paper and what do I see, Jimmy Canoe Comeback tour. \n \n I sat up so fast, I spilled nearly all my coffee on myself. The hot, sticky mess that now stained my previously clean work shirt went unnoticed as my mind went back 20 years. \n \n Jimmy called my agency out of the blue and asked for me specifically. I don ’ t know how much you know about the business but that is not the way things are usually done. Either you know a guy, and you deal with him directly, or you get in touch with an agency and they send out a rep who gets all the information and sends out a bid to the whole agency then I and the other hitmen try to get the contract and fill it. Obviously, I like the first option better, because when you aren ’ t racing the completion, you have way more time to set the thing up perfectly. Don ’ t get me wrong, flying by the seat of your pants is part of the job and I enjoyed more that was necessarily healthy, but there is just something about killing a mark the right way that makes the whole experience perfect. Having that one job go so well, just nailing it with no flaws, feels like diving for a ball out in right field, snatching it out of the air and beating the home team in the bottom of the ninth. \n \n It was strange that Jimmy called the agency, because he did actually know me, we were friends, in so far as people like me could have friends outside the business. Hell, we even played together in a garage band growing up. His older brother and I were the same age and we needed a bass player, Jimmy had only played trumpet and piano before but he could shred within a month. Pretty soon his brother John had to give up the guitar and let Jimmy play ( all for the good of the band ). I had seen Jimmy a few times since high school, but he hadn ’ t seen me. I caught a few of his shows and I tell you, the kid really had it. \n \n He has me come up to his house for a meeting. House? What a joke, Jimmy lived in a castle. One of those big places, out west on the coast. The property was six acres with a wall around the whole thing. The gate was open when I drove up and a guard waved at me as I drove by. I actually knew the guard, he used to work for the same agency as me until he got picked up by a private security firm, but that is another story. \n \n I didn ’ t really know what to expect, how many people can a filthy rich rock star want dead? Probably his producer, or his wife. Probably something easy and quick but ultimately uninteresting. Boy was I wrong. He didn ’ t want me to kill anyone, at least not yet. I sat down with Jimmy by his pool, overlooking the pacific and for a while the meeting was strictly social. I wanted to know what touring was like and believe me when I say this guy could tell you some stories. He wanted to know all about my life, I told him what I could, maybe even a bit more than was wise, because I was less cautious at that time than I was when I started out. \n \n Eventually after several bottles of some very nice wine he talked about retirement. This was the last thing on my mind but I could tell the years on the road had worn Jimmy. He got really into drugs for a while then cleaned up in the past few years but he made it very clear that he was ready to give it up for good. \n \n “ Music is the greatest thing in my life, ” Jimmy had told me, “ But I have a family and it is time I make them the most important. ” \n \n Then he pulled out a duffle bag and put it by my chair. \n \n “ I ’ m going to do a farewell tour, ” he said, “ Then I am out for good. I want to hire you but that money is yours whether you actually have to do the job or not. My last show is on the fourth of July this year. If I ever go on tour again, I want you to kill me. ” \n \n I admit I was shocked, and in those days I prided myself on being the kind of guy who wasn ’ t surprised by anything. “ Look man, if you want to quit just quit, this isn ’ t a game it ’ s your life. ” \n \n “ I know. I know what this means and I don ’ t ever want to go back on this deal, believe me. After this last ride, if I ever get started up again, I ’ ll know what ’ s coming. ” \n \n *I ’ ll know what ’ s coming* \n \n Those words bounced around my head all the rest of that day. On the porch, in the shower, sitting in traffic, even at the shop. I thought a lot about how I gave up the game, how I said I ’ d never take another contract. I thought about how killing Jimmy wasn ’ t even a *new* contract. In the end I told Toni, one of the girls who owns part of the shop, she would need to run things for a week or two while I went to see my sister. I don ’ t have a sister. \n \n Eighteen hours after I got the news, I was in Jimmy ’ s house. He still lived in the same mansion but his security was reduced to a single rent-a-cop in the gate house, not one of the heavy hitter like before. \n \n “ I was hoping you ’ d come. ” \n \n Light flooded the room and my old friend sat up in bed. He looked awful. His face once, tan and a little fat, was now pale, and he had lost so much weight that his empty skin sagged off his skull like a melting candle. \n \n Jimmy reached pushed a control and the bed began to tilt forward into a sitting position, his arms were thin, like a child ’ s arms that had been stretched to fit an adult body, I couldn ’ t see his legs but even under the covers I could tell they were no more than a frail remnant of what they once were. \n \n “ As you can see, Michael, the years have not be as kind to me as they have been to you. ” \n \n “ What do you have? ” I asked him. The situation was clear to me now. He wanted a way out and I was going to be it. \n \n “ Cancer, obviously, a few different varieties I am afraid. Some are terminal and even without them certain treatments for the others all react poorly with each other. I have been dying for a year now, they wanted to give me drugs for the pain but I gave that up a long time ago. ” \n \n ***When I started writing this I just let it get away from me. I had no idea there was a character limit so the rest is in a reply to this comment*** \n \n \n\n"}

Some of them have even begun bringing their children to see us, a rite of passage perhaps. They hide in the undergrowth just outside the clearing, disturbing the leaves just enough to give away their presence, big brown eyes glistening. When we come out of the cave, they ca n't hold back gasps of wonderment at the sight of two tall people, wrapped not in furs but in colourful fabrics; feet in boots, not hides tied with sinew. \n \n They keep their distance. They think we are spirits and are afraid to anger us. I find this a mixed blessing; after all these millennia on an Earth empty of people, to have some of our own kind around us again! To be held in the bosom of a community! But we can never join their village. They are too different. It would n't be fair to them, for their gods to decide to live among them. \n \n It would also be dangerous to us. Close contact with those not like us will erode our specialness, and eventually make us mortal. There is so much to live for, now! When we look at these brown-eyed folk, camouflaged in the shrubbery, we know we are looking at the Pyramids. The Acropolis. Chartres cathedral. Samurai. Machu Picchu. The Bible. Hamlet. What a waste, to miss all that! No, we will remain and bear witness to history. We will make our own community. \n \n There is also this to live for: I am pregnant at last! We had begun to lose hope that it would ever be possible for us to have children. When our exile began, we were told that we would only occasionally be fertile. Perhaps the nearness of other humans has brought it on? Whatever the reason for this blessing, we are thrilled. Finally, we will be more than just two! We will be a family, growing through the ages alongside the family of humanity. I wonder what history will say of us? \n \n I wonder how these villagers will receive the information that there will soon be a third god living in the forest above their home? \n \n ~ \n \n They are in the bushes again. Perhaps they have brought some of our own children to see us this time. They are easily recognizable, taller, somewhat lighter of hair than the other villagers. And fatter. They receive the best food, the first choice of meat. My daughter, whom they named Agathway but whom I named Diana, is bent with age now, and a priestess. She ca n't crouch low in the undergrowth like younger folk can, and her white hair and the ropes of polished shell she wears stand out against the dark forest. She ventures closer than the others, raising a hand hesitantly in what is clearly a ritual gesture. The others encourage her subtly, and push forward two of our younger children as well. They do their duty as go-betweens, approaching the gods, their parents, but it is clear they are terrified. They are our children, and they are terrified of us. They are mortal, and they will die, as they all have since our first, what must be several hundred years ago now. For the twentieth time, I look at my child and know that I will never see her again. Diana, Agathway, will die this winter of old age. She knows this too, yet still, she is more afraid of us than she is of this knowledge. She drops her trembling hand and backs away. A murmur and a sigh goes up from the leaves. My heart breaks. \n \n And all of history is still to come.\n"}

For the most part you were quiet, but occasionally you gave whisper of a cry in there and it broke my heart because I wanted you to know you were safe. But you ’ d only just met me and the woman you did know, your lovely foster mother, was now somewhere far, far away. I couldn ’ t blame you for being scared. \n \n My boyfriend and I had only just moved into our apartment, so there wasn ’ t much for you there yet, but you didn ’ t seem to care. You weren ’ t in the mood for exploring. You found safety behind the washing machine and you hid there for three days. It broke my heart each night when I laid down in bed and realized this was another full day I didn ’ t get to see you, hug you, and tell you I love you. And I loved you so much but you didn ’ t let me show you. In the meantime I sat on the bathroom floor, just talking to you, wondering if you were listening or if you asleep back there. I made sure to speak quietly and use your name often, and your foster mom told me that you grew up with NPR playing in the background, so when I wasn ’ t there to talk to you I left my phone on the sink so you could listen to what I always thought stood for Nerd Public Radio. I left a little pile of food in front of the washing machine and I made sure your water bowl was there so you didn ’ t have to go far. You weren ’ t born yesterday, you weren ’ t a kitten—you needed your time and space, and as much as it killed me, I made sure to give it to you. \n \n Then the fourth day came, and while I was sitting on the couch enjoying the last weekend before my new job started, you came out of the hallway, jumped onto the couch, and laid yourself across my belly like a blanket. I hugged you and cried, and you just stretched as far as you could and settled on your side. You let me pet the cloud that is your tummy and your heavy purrs vibrated through me like a gentle wave. This was my first experience of true love, attachment, and euphoria. I thought you, my first ever pet, would never come to love me. But there you were, enjoying the utter bliss of the love I ’ d bottled up for you for three long days. \n \n \n We ’ ve been inseparable ever since. You ’ re always there waiting for me at the door when I come home from work, and you meow your complaints about where I ’ ve been but the stress only lasts a few seconds. Because right after I take off my shoes and coat, and you and I lay on the couch together while I hold you close against me like I did my first stuffed animal. And while you purr, I stroke your head as we watch those dumb cooking shows. We have a ritual, you and I, and I can ’ t tell which of the two of us loves it more. Personally I think I do, but I guess I ’ m a little biased. \n \n You ’ re larger than most cats, a whopping eighteen pound Maine Coon mix, but I think you forget that sometimes. You barely fit in the cat tree I bought you but you try your damnedest to squish in there anyway. And I have to hold your head and front paws up if you want to sit on my lap, because you just can ’ t get all of yourself on there, but it ’ s ok because you let me pet your jellybean toes every time you try. You ’ re ridiculously soft and so wondrously warm; I can ’ t imagine going to bed anymore with you there under my arm, pressed against my stomach. \n \n I cherish you and love you and look forward to the many years we have left together. Sometimes I wish I ’ d met you while you were still a kitten, but I imagine you were probably the sweetheart of the litter. But instead of dwelling on what could have been, I ’ ll just pet you while you sit beside me on the couch, snoring and dreaming of I can ’ t even imagine what. I ’ ll keep smothering you with love, and the boyfriend will do the same after he comes home from a long day of being overworked and underpaid, and we ’ ll keep kissing you on the forehead before bed. \n \n We love you, and I really hope you know that. \n\n"}

I traced my fingers across the foot-thick glass and it felt cold. Was it just my imagination, or was it truly that *cold* down here? \n \n `` The data from the anglerfish genome have been really amazing,'' Pamela said, taking us deeper as she spoke. I watched pieces of deep-sea detritus and small, transparent organisms swirling around in the beams of light. \n \n `` It's almost like..'' \n \n Pamela cleared her throat, then shook her head. `` It's stupid.'' \n \n I looked over at Pamela. We had been working together for many years, in fact had same the PhD adviser and had been graduate students together. Even after all this time, Pamela had the terrible habit of doubting herself. It left me to wonder how many breakthroughs lay in the bottom of her waste bin, discarded before they could be born. \n \n `` Pamela, you know this is a safe space.'' She punched me in the arm, but smiled warmly, then shrugged. \n \n `` Look, when I've run the cladograms, there are a few where the anglerfish come up ancestral. Basal.'' \n \n I shrugged. `` Alternative, less parsimonious trees are common. Nothing embarrassing about that. So you've got an alternate tree where anglerfish are basal to other bony fish, so what?'' \n \n Pamela shook her head. `` To *everything*,'' she said quietly. \n \n I laughed sharply. `` Pamela, that's absurd.'' I instantly felt bad. *Nice safe space you've created, asshole. * \n \n I cleared my throat. `` I mean, some of the best ideas have been ridiculed at first, though... who knows, maybe... I mean,'' \n \n I was tripping over myself now, and Pamela graciously saved me. `` Look, Steve, I know, it's silly. I said so when I brought it up.'' She looked out the other window and I felt the moment slipping away. \n \n `` Well, what do you think it could be? I mean, what could explain that?'' \n \n `` Panspermia.'' She said simply. \n \n `` You mean life originated off-world. *That* panspermia?'' I said. \n \n She shrugged. `` Imagine if they came here fully formed, along with the single cells that started everything else off. Maybe from the same world. Maybe the Anglerfish were the only macroscopic life to survive, somehow.'' \n \n We traveled on. I was lost in thought. I felt a growing feeling in my gut, heavy and thick and cold. `` Pamela,'' I said, my hand shooting out to grasp her arm. At first I could n't tell what was making me nervous, then I knew. I saw it. *The bottom. * We were far, far below safe depth. I heard a creak. Imagined I heard a pop. The metal must be straining against the pressure. Any instant, we could disappear. Cease to be in a flash of compression and decompression and foot-thick metal crunching in on itself like a discarded paper ball. \n \n `` Pamela, where are we?'' \n \n She smiled at me. `` Shhh, Steve, it's okay. We're at the lip of Challenger Deep.'' The submersible gently slid to the ocean floor, and I saw we were on the edge of a chasm that, despite our incredible depth, descended below out of sight and beyond reason. \n \n `` Pamela, get us out of here,'' I said, frantic. I looked over at her and she was calm. Serene. She had turned away from the controls and was making eye contact with me. She placed her hands gently on my shoulders. \n \n `` Steve, what if the Anglerfish were n't the only things that have been here all along, waiting? What if the Anglerfish were n't here first?'' \n \n Pamela's eyes. There was something about them. Something in my brain was shouting at me to run. *Where? * Shouting at me to fight. *There's no need. * Shouting at me to resist in any way. *You want this. * I could n't break contact. \n \n `` Pamela,'' I said, and I could hear my voice quavering as I spoke. `` You never told me where you were born. We worked together all this time, and you never...'' \n \n She put a finger to my lips, and crossed her arms over her body, gripping her shirt hem and lifting it over her head. Her bra was white and lacy patterned. Beads of sweat were visible on her bare chest and along the lean, taught skin of her stomach. \n \n `` You want this, Steve...'' she whispered, and as she spoke I thought I caught a glimpse of needle-like teeth between her lips. `` We were meant for each other. We always were..'' \n \n `` No, Pamela, I..'' but as I spoke I knew it was true. I was meant for her. My place was with her. My place was as a *part* of her. It was time to bring the circle to a close. It was time to fulfill my purpose. It was time to make the incomplete complete. \n \n A fissure began to form at Pamela's belly button, opening and running like the spiderwebs of cracking lake ice in the spring thaw. It split its way around her side, wrapping up toward her spine. As she leaned over it opened wide, impossibly wide, revealing a red, angry gash. Blood dripped and poured down her side as her body leaned at a sickening, impossible angle. Her hand opened and gently gripped the top of my head and she began pulling me toward the wound in her side. The pressure was the gentle, intimate pressure of a lover. The pressure of someone who knew I would not resist. \n \n What happened next was a folding of space and time that would make no sense described in three dimensions. I'll try. I folded my hands in front of my like a diver, and felt them slide smoothly into the groove in her side. I slid into my groove, fitting perfectly and merging despite the impossibilities of scale, my clothing sliding off and away as my flesh merged with hers. This brings us to the present... \n \n I feel, *know* somehow that acid in her flesh is eating away at mine, dissolving the space where her body ends and mine begins. I sense the borders of *me* fading away, feel my thoughts becoming less organized and less my own as my body becomes part of hers. I feel my selfness fading, know that not for long will coherent.. but I want, want, want. \n \n `` Make me part of you,'' my mouth says. \n \n `` Make me part...'' \n \n `` Make...'' \n \n -- - \n \n Tenderly Pamela strokes the flesh on her side that was Steve, smoothing over the little bump that used to be the mouth into a flat, smooth surface. `` Shhh,'' she says soothingly, feeling his last thoughts spread out and become lost like oil on the surface of a puddle as the last of his brain dissolves. Only his gonads will remain, pumping fertile sperm into her body to conceive the next generation. \n \n Pamela gives the engine one last burst of fuel, pushing the little submersible over the edge and into the abyss. \n \n \n \n\n"}

You get the idea. But we try to make sure Jeff does n't feel that way. I mean, he knows it too - it's coded into his being - but he would n't be the first person to try to escape what he is. Yes, I said person. It's a habit now. \n \n Jeff is a reject from the AI companion company DroidCon. You know, the one that makes robots that live in people's houses and do all the cooking, cleaning, watching the kids, and so on. And *other* things, if you want. \n \n But Jeff, bless him, he just was n't cut out for all that. I guess something went wrong in his manufacture, because he's far more concerned with fitting in than he is with following orders. He's... *anxious* for lack of a better word. Let me backtrack a moment: Jeff belongs to my best mate Brandon. Brandon's dad did a runner when he was little and his mum got Jeff at a discount as house-help. But Jeff just could n't do anything properly. Broke half a set of dishes once. Brandon's mum was all about to junk him for being too defective, but she realized Brandon had gotten a bit attached ( he was having a tough time at school then, before he moved to our district and met us ). \n \n And when Brandon *did* meet us, years later, Jeff was in tow and acting like a proper friend, even maybe like a cool older brother. And after a brief period of awkwardness we all decided he was just that. One of the club. It helped that he had no problem sneaking us booze from the locked cabinet at Brandon's house. He laughed at our jokes. He helped us when we fell down. He was a walking, talking Google search engine who had an answer for just about everything. Steve, our resident bookworm and debate team aficionado, was none too pleased at first, but then realized the merits of an informed opponent. Jeff is more knowledgeable and also more opinionated than most humans I've met. \n \n And sure, maybe Jeff does n't breath or eat and needs to sit in a recharge pod for 6 hours instead of sleeping like we do, but honestly there are more obvious ways he could be different. He's done better by us than most people we've met, and that's something. \n \n It's taken me a long time to realize just how special Jeff is. None of the rest of our families had an android, and so we assumed that they were all *mostly* like Jeff. Maybe less clumsy. \n \n But just the other day, a representative from DroidCon showed up at Brandon's house all curious and wanting to see Jeff. Dunno how they heard about him. \n \n But what got me is that, for the first time since I've known him, Jeff looks scared.\n"}

The message comes in form of sticky note this time, so it almost certainly is n't some weird coincidence. My next assumption is that it's a bizarre prank, so I cryptically ask all of my friends if they know anything about a movie with `` ten days to live'' as its tagline. Our ensuing discussions remind me that I do n't know anyone clever enough to pull a prank like this. \n \n Retrospectively, I have no idea why I was so scared. I almost never respond to those `` copy and paste this message or die'' things, but this was different. \n \n The same routine continues for the next eight days. I forget about it until the third - what could I do? I'm a busy man. But when I got the post-it that said I had three days to live... I lost it. \n \n It was all I could think about. I called the cops once, but they did n't care. They said it was just a joke. They do n't know anything. I just fund their jobs if I get killed, why would they want to save me? \n \n I did n't leave my house on the final day. If I did n't get the post-it, I could n't die, right? That made sense to me. It still does. But I made a mistake. I checked my email. What did I see? One message. From my brother. Subject: One day left to live.

But know... he's... well... how do I put it nicely?'' replied the Saucepan, shuffling forward. \n \n `` Put it nicely? **P-PUT IT NICELY?! ** **YOU *CARE* ABOUT THAT SLOB?! **'' screeched the Toaster, flailing their plug about angrily, hopping up and down on the spot. \n `` Well, y-y-yeah!

What is it that's made you so angry?'' I asked, cautiously stepping towards the furious toaster. \n \n `` ***I... *** **I... ** *I... * I want to make the toast!'' said the Toaster, its face changing to a slightly afraid, sad expression. \n \n `` Wh-what?'' I replied, bewildered. \n \n `` The toast! You're always the one making it! G-Getting out the bag, putting it in and stuff... I-I just want a chance to do it!'' the Toaster said, motioning towards the bag to the left of him, filled with sliced bread. \n \n I started at the toaster, who looked at the bread sadly. \n \n `` You... you could have just said this all at the beginning, y'know? I mean, I totally would have let you make toast! That would be super helpful.'' I said, picking up the bag of toast and spinning it in my hands. \n \n `` R-Really?'' said the Toaster, reaching towards the bag. \n \n `` Yeah, really!'' I replied, placing the bag next to the Toaster. I stared into the Toaster's bright, happy eyes. They looked like a little kid on Christmas morning as they glanced towards the bag of toast. \n\n"}

Let's get the fuck outta here!'' \n \n Someone in the front was shouting as the ship shook violently once more. I looked towards the hatch to see what was keeping us grounded. A man was at the hatch with his daughter in his arms and a young soldier was keeping them from entering. She was crying. The man was yelling. But both of their voices were being drowned out by the cacophonous noises outside: the whipping of rushing wind as it passed the ship's opening, the faint sound of gunfire in the distance, the rumbling of nearby ships taking off. The man was growing desparate as he kept yelling, but the soldier continued to bar his entrance. \n \n He kept pointing into the ship, at the space in the front, and kept looking at everyone near the hatch. It was true that we could have squeezed him in, it would not even have been difficult. We'd all heard the stories, though. Some of them may have even seen it. Ships that were unable to break the earth's atmosphere because people packed onto them like sardines. It was impossible to know what the tipping point was, just that it was always a possibility. For that reason everyone near the hatch kept restlessly pushing and shoving as though there was no more room on the ship. The shouting from the front grew louder and less cohesive and the man at the hatch grew more restless. \n \n BANG \n \n Despite all the noise from the outside, the sound of the shot rang through the ship as though he had shot next to everyone's ears. Everyone inside of the ship fell quiet instantly. The soldier had fired a round over the man's shoulder and placed the muzzle against his head. The man stared into the soldiers eyes, then looked down at his daughter who continued to cry. He kissed his daughter on the forehead and looked up again at the man. He whispered to the soldier and held out his daughter. The soldier stood, never lowering his gun, and slowly took the girl from his arms. The man slowly stepped back as the soldier holstered his gun and turned around to close the hatch. His hand was shaking as he reached for the lever. The man stared from the bridge. His face was stoic. The soldier finally pulled the lever and the hatch slammed close, shutting out all noise from the outside. \n \n The soldier's hands were trembling and his facade fell away as tears began to pour from the corners of his eyes. Getting a good look at his face, for the first time, he could n't have been older than 18. His legs gave away and he fell, clutching the girl in his arms that continued to cry. Their sobs were the only sounds echoing through the ship as it began the pre-takeoff procedures. Everyone was quietly avoiding each other's stares. It was n't the soldier's fault. It was nobody's fault. The ship was already over capacity. The man was just unfortunate. Everything around us began to rumble as the ship began to take off. The girl asked the soldier something that I did n't catch, and he just held her closer. I strained my ears to hear over the rumbling. \n \n ``... where is he? Where's dad?'' \n \n My heart dropped. As the rumbling grew louder I could barely hear the little girl's voice. \n \n `` Brother where did dad go?''\n"}

I had grown up a lot since then. That's why it was so unusual for me to hear this knock. Again, came another knock. What struck me was how calm it was. It caused me no fear. I thought I had better answer it. \n \n I got up to open the door and I was awestruck by what stood before me. A creature of complete darkness stood there, towering over me, looking down on me with those big, red eyes, making my stomach fall down to my feet. Its eyes were so terrifying that I somehow missed that mouth, full of giant, pearly white fangs, dripping with a drool that just seemed to anticipate the taste of human flesh. That mouth hung open and came closer to me. The creature opened its mouth further, as if to speak. \n \n `` Oh, hello, Mark'' it said. Needless to say, I was confused. \n \n `` Hi'' I replied, before adding `` do I know you''? \n \n `` Oh, I'm Blrrghhhgghllrgh'' he replied. `` I've lived in your closet for the past twenty years'' he informed me. \n \n `` Do you also live under my bed'' I asked. `` Yes, yes, the bed, the basement, the attic, the radio...''. \n \n `` The TV?'' I asked. \n \n `` No, that's just crazy talk'' he replied. \n \n We stood there, staring at each other, like two old friends who suddenly realize that they have nothing to say to each other. We stared, occasionally smiling politely and looking down at our shoes. Finally, I broke the silence. \n \n `` So, why were you knocking on the door?'' \n \n `` Can I borrow a cup of cockroaches?'' he replied. \n \n `` Sorry, I have no roaches'' I told him. \n \n He thanked me, told me it was nice to see me again and left.

Instead, things had gone, more or less, *swimmingly*. \n \n `` Face it, Sven! We're the same!'' Sven scoffed. \n \n Izac rolled his eyes and sighed.

Izac only grunted in reply. \n \n As Izac advanced toward the cavern, his metal flying shoes shooting out jets of flame, lifting him into the air, and his fire-wand out, cracking like a whip, ejecting smoking shell casings like rain, Sven rolled himself out of the drivers-side door. He pressed one hand lovingly on the rune-encrusted surface of his autocar, as the other curled around the handle of his sword. The crystals glimmering brightly in the engine compartment. \n \n `` We're the same?'' He laughed to himself, and shook his head `` *Riiiight. *'' \n \n And with a hearty yell, he drew his blade, and *charged*. \n \n THE END\n"}

I do know one skill that's always good to have: how to handle a handgun. \n \n I met the guy with a wad of hundreds- all the money I have- in my hand. `` Is that all of it?'' He asked, hesitant about the whole transaction. Unfairly distributing credits is punishable, in some states, by death. `` Yep'' I said, reaching for the small bag of credits. He handed it to me and then reached for the cash, but I put it back in my pocket. I pulled out the gun, already backing away. `` Hey- you ca n't, you ca n't do that!''

I decided to buy it. \n \n The man gave me a bag to put the skills in and a complimentary needle to administer them with, and said a happy `` good night!'' As I left.

There was stuff in that note that I had never wanted to think about again. It was like having my entire life shoved into a single pill and force fed to me. I could n't die now! I was less than two months away from graduating from the university. I was studying to be a fashion designer, I already had the interest of a small startup in New York. I had a girlfriend, an apartment, a dog. I could n't leave that all behind! But how would this Sarah person know all of this personal stuff about me? I needed a drink, fast. Even though it was only 1 o'clock, I stumbled to the nearest bar I could find. \n \n The place look very shady. As if high stakes drug deals might be going on in the back room. A group of very muscular punks with sleeveless shirts occupied a booth, but other than that I had the bar to myself. I sat down at the bar and the bartender walked over. He looked as if he were in his late 40's. HE was wearing a sweatshirt and a toboggan, even though it was summer. He had bloodshot eyes and a nose that looked as if it had been broke and regrew the wrong way. \n \n `` What'll it be?'' \n \n `` Just give me a bottle of bourbon'' \n \n I slowly drank through the bottle all afternoon. I hated the taste of it, but I needed something to dull the pain. By around eight that night, that bar was packed. A bunch of rough looking men that you would n't want to meet in an ally occupied most of the bar. I had just finished my second bottle, and was about to order the third, but the bartender stopped me. I guess a clean faced kid in his early 20's did n't really fit in with the norm. \n \n `` Get out kid, you do n't belong here. If you're upset about something, go see a therapist, you ca n't drink your problems away. I do n't want to see you round here again. Okay?'' \n \n Huh, get that. The old man must of had a sympathetic side to him. He could obviously see what I was trying to do. At this point I did n't really care, so I stumbled out the door and down the street to my car. I checked my phone. Apparently I had not shown up for classes, or my anniversary dinner with my girlfriend. None of that mattered any more though. I slowly found the keys to my car in my pocket, and took an even longer time trying to get the car started. I was on my normal route to get to my apartment, when, out of nowhere, a tree sprung right into the middle of the street, and right into the hood of my car. \n \n Let's take a minute out from the story here. I know what you all must be thinking. `` It's crazy to get this upset over death. Death ca n't be THAT bad, can it?''

I'd only spent one day with this fucker. One! and I'd had to threaten to drown him on three separate occasions. The first time had been when he had first come aboard only a day ago insulted my beautiful vessel, calling it a dingy. The second came about from his complaining of the lack of water while afloat from MY sunken ship. Damn boy knew it had been my ship and still chose to rant and carry on about his problems. Why I chose to save his sorry ass I'll never know. I've found nothing good about him in the last 24 hours. He's just dead weight and a whiner. My only blood and such a bitch.\n"}

The setting we are in seems to be some sort of ritualistic gathering in which a group of youngsters, young adolescents perhaps, has gathered to engage in some sort of mystic dance ritual in which they make pelvic contact in an odd, sexualized way. Curiously, there are a group of markedly disapproving fully-grown humans that seem to be overseeing the event, as if to discourage and shame the lewd behavior of the pod of pubescents. \n The female recognizes the glances from the male even from a distance. I can only speculate from here, but she appears to not be dismissing his visual curiosity at all. Simultaneously, she shows no signs of soliciting any further attention nor engage in communication. Across the room, she sees the male, much taller than what we call his “ classmates ”, and awkward of movement. Another male, shorter in stature, begins to converse with in what appears to be a pleading, annoyed way. He pushes his gawky friend in the direction of the young woman and she is startled. The tall boy becomes off balance as he is pushed in the direction of the girl that has him so intrigued. They make eye contact in a moment of cinematographic proportions. The opportunity to go back is behind them. \n He approaches her, tangibly tremoring in front of his prospective mate. She greets him with the standard salutation of man, “ Hi. ” \n After stammering slightly, the male begins to communicate verbally, unsure of each word he speaks. They share an uncertain air of familiarity, as if they were enrolled in a human educational course together. In a flash of pure inhibition, the boy blurted out a rushed slur of words suggesting that the two spend recreational time together. She is taken aback. The onslaught of confidence summoned from thin air by the male both impressed and flattered her. Externally, she was baring her teeth in a pleased manner and was giggling involuntarily. He was perspiring above the upper lip. She harshly nodded her head north-south to signify acceptance to the invitation to “ a movie and Cold Stone ”. His worried nature was abated and he embraced her quickly. She entered her contact information on an artifact known as an “ iPhone ” that illuminated the dimly lit auditorium. She quickly thrusted his device back into his hands, and scurried away to a group of her female peers, who were giggling as humanoids their age often do. \n While the process of young humans innocent way of seduction is uncomfortable for both parties, one can observe that juvenile adulation is a truly memorable and important mark in human lives and their development. \n\n"}

Ron Hawks raised the glass to his lips, feeling the cheap amber fluid burn as if flowed down his throat. So many signs that something was wrong. \n \n It was the smell that finally did it. He could see that now. Subways he had run always had their own particular stink to them. Cigarette smoke, fast food, coffee. Sweat and perfume always permeated the fabric, soaking deeper than anyone could possibly clean. Bits of shit and vomit from the odd child or loon always found some dark unreachable corner where they would lay, ignored as they dried and decayed. Life had a smell to it, a smell that lingered and creeped with you as you walked the empty cars at the end of your shift. Except his train didn ’ t. At least, it didn ’ t smell like life. \n \n He swished the burning fluid from cheek to cheek. He had never really quit, no matter how often he said he would. No matter how many times he told people he had gone dry. The bottle had always been in the back of his mind. A dark and patient friend waiting for him to crawl back. It ’ s why he took the job. That should have been the first sign. \n \n 16 years of screwing up. 16 years of bouncing from job to job, city to city after he showed up to one too many shifts reeking of booze. One too many sloppy runs. He had never killed anyone, never broke anything, never hurt anyone. God only knows how. It had kept him working, never quite screwing up to that point of no return, but given enough time, everyone could see he was an accident waiting to happen. Mathew ’ s hadn ’ t asked him about that, about his old jobs. That should have been a sign. \n \n Late shift, one long run back and forth, night after night. No transfers, no turns, no other cars on the track. The prison track seemed like a miracle job. He could make the run shitfaced, not that he did, he was quitting again, but he could. No one bothered him, no one talked to him about the wife and children he no longer had. No one picked at old wounds. Just himself and the tunnel. It was…simple. \n \n Prisoners and other supplies. That ’ s what they told him he ’ d be carrying. They told him he was working for the law. He should have looked into it. What kind of a place transports their prisoners in the middle of the night? By dedicated subway? He should have looked into it. \n \n Ron grimaced as he took another gulp. The lines running across his face had always been older than the body that held them. They had grown even older that night. He took a moment to pour another glass. He downed it in one quick go and poured another. He should have… \n \n He didn ’ t know why he had gone back that night. Minor malfunction, should have sat tight. They told him to sit tight and wait for the repair crew. But instead he went back with the passengers. It was stupid. He didn ’ t know how many there were, how they were held. He couldn ’ t see his passengers get on, another sign. Another reason he should have asked ‘ why? ’ \n \n He could have been walking into a car packed full of unchained psychopaths. He took a swig and almost wished that he had. The guards, he had wanted to tell the guards what was going on. That was what he told himself at the time. Now, slowly poisoning himself in the dark of his apartment, Ron could admit the real reason to himself. It was the smell, he had to know why his train didn ’ t smell right. \n \n With a gentle sob, Ron let his head rest against the hard wood of the table. There had been so many of them. Corpses, stacked like cordwood. Not even covered, just piled on the floor. Closing his eyes tight, Ron tried to shut out their broken and bloated faces from his mind. Their lifeless eyes stared at him in the darkness. The hard man cried softly into the wood. \n \n Broken, every one of them had been broken. Every one of their dead faces was a mask of pain and fear. They stared at him from the pile with their limbs twisted and torn. Their skin shiny and bloated. Not just men. Women, men, young, old, every race, every type…children. Ron let out a soft wail of anguish. Children. Why were there children? Why would someone do that to children? \n \n Like a coward he had rushed back to the front. He sat in silence and waited for the repair crew. Rushed back to his dingy apartment and his patient friend. \n Months of work, almost two years, and he didn ’ t know anything about what he had actually been doing. Miles of track in the dark, no way of knowing where it truly began and where it ended. His checks were signed by a subcontractor. A middleman that stood between middlemen. They had told him he was working for the state. He didn ’ t know, not really, if it was true. He didn ’ t know if he hoped it was true. Five nights a week, for 19 months, he had been carrying bodies. Hundreds of bodies, thousands. Where did they come from? How could there be so many? How had nobody noticed this? \n \n He didn ’ t bother with the glass. With desperation he gulped the stinging alcohol straight from the bottle, letting the searing liquid ’ s pain distract him from the faces that now haunted him. It let him escape for a moment. Just a moment. \n \n Why were there children? \n\n"}

It bears consequence on many crucial phases of development in humans, including a longer gestation, an extended period of offspring dependence on parents and a relatively late occurrence of sexual maturity. Our programme today examines and explains a crucial episode of humans ’ transition into adulthood, scientifically referred to as “ peer group and mate selection ”, but commonly known as “ highschool ”. \n \n \n Adolescent humans are typically pack animals. Though they still rely on the elders of the group to provide them with shelter, food and protection, they prefer the company of peers of similar ages and, often, of the same gender. Observe the young males. Upon entering the courtyard of the educational compound, they greet one another with exclamations which vary in eagerness, to reflect the current social hierarchy. The grooming and socializing rituals commence, as the males regale one another with their most recent exploits in the worlds of physical and electronic sports. \n \n Notice the most recent arrival. His participation in the exchange remains perfunctory, as his attention is primarily concentrated on a nearby group of adolescent females. Following his unwavering gaze, we may deduce which of the potential mates has captivated him. Perhaps sensing that she is being watched, she surveys her environment and catches him in the act. The male tentatively lifts a hand, open palm facing away from him, as a form of salute. She responds in kind, then returns to the grooming rituals of her own group. \n \n Encouraged by this exchange, the male feels prepared for the final attack. With the help of a crude technological implement, an almost defunct Macintosh portable telephone, he relays a short message to the female. The message combines two of the most popular forms of writing devised by humans: phonetic and hieroglyphic. The text reads, “ wan na go out Sat.? ” and is followed by conventional graphical representations of cinematography and nourishment. \n \n A brief, shrill sound alerts the female to the receiving of the message. She is on the verge of reading it when the leader of the female pack brusquely acquires the telephone and very loudly declares the content of the communication to the adolescents currently present, who react with amusement. Painfully aware of the development, the male places both palms over his face, in a futile attempt to isolate himself from the situation. \n \n It will be another hour until the male receives a reply. Though females are typically assumed to be more expansive in their verbal and written output, this particular individual has opted for conciseness. In her message, the letter “ k ” precedes a schematic representation of a smiling human face. The male ’ s attempt has been successful, for the moment. Join us next week for the conclusion of this fascinating ritual.\n"}

He was n't particularly spectacular. He had that kind of air a lot of wealthy middle aged guys with heavy wallets have. That sense of superiority, of confidence and what could only be described as devilish charm. Or he would have struck me as such, had he not been unconscious. But he looked the part. Tall, with broad shoulders and a barrel chest. He had dark hair that had greyed in picture perfect fashion along his temples. His skin was bronzed and tanned into the pleasant leather that every gold digger watched for. All in all, he looked like Ray Wise. \n \n He was laying flat on the stretcher they had wheeled him in on. They had cut off his clothes, a black pin-stripe suit that probably cost more than what I make in a month. But I did n't pay too much attention to that. Behind me, one of the interns made a joke about a `` pin-strip'' suit while tossing the remains into a bio-hazard bag. \n \n `` What happened?'' I asked the nurse on duty. She handed me the report. A stab wound. Severe blood loss. I looked down at him. He did n't look pale. I looked back up to the nurse, arching an eyebrow in a quizzical fashion. \n `` I know. But that is n't the weirdest part.'' She said. I tried to elevate my eyebrow, but it was as high as it would go. She rolled her eyes at me and scowled, pulling back the sheet over his stomach. I looked back down to the patient before taking a step back. \n \n Someone had stabbed him with a crucifix. I do n't mean like someone had tied a cross guard onto a sharpened stick. I mean a wooden crucifix complete with a little metal Jesus. I was looking at Jesus, knee deep in this guy's stomach. \n \n `` Christ.'' I exhaled to myself. \n \n `` Obviously.'' She said, giving me a sideways glance. I ignored her and looked back to the patient. Jesus was looking down at the patient's hairy naval. It was then I noticed something... peculiar to say the least. I leaned in closer. \n He was burnt. It looked as though someone had tried to cauterize the wound. I inhaled and immediately jerked back. I had smelled some nasty things in my life, but I had never had a burn victim smell like... sulfur, I guess. \n `` Nurse, have you noticed these burns?'' I asked her, signalling one of the interns to bring me some gloves. The nurse shook her head and looked at the wound. \n \n `` No. Can we remove it safely?'' She asked, pulling back in much the same manner I did. \n `` We're going to have to, to see what it looks like in there.'' I said, pulling on the gloves the intern gave me. The nurse started to say something before I grabbed the crucifix and pulled. It slipped out effortlessly, without any resistance at all in fact. I stumbled backwards before looking at my hand. One was clean, the other, soaked in dark red blood and clutching a crimson Christ. \n \n I was shocked to say the least. I had expected some effort required, maybe a caught foot. But it felt like the body pushed the thing out on its own. I shook the thought from my head and put the crucifix in another bio-hazard bag one of the interns was holding out at arm's length. A sharp inhale snapped my neck back towards the patient. \n The nurse had taken a step back from the patient and was pointing a trembling finger at the body on the stretcher. I looked at him. The smell of sulfur hit my nose before my eyes put together what they were seeing. The wound, gaping and mangled, was closing like a hungry maw. Smoke, black and putrid, poured from the hole and disappeared into the vents. I held my breath and shouldered an intern away from the cloud. \n \n A moment later, he was laying on the table, with nothing but a fading scar on his stomach. The nurse was saying something, but I was n't paying attention to her. My eyes were on the patient. First, he flexed his fingers. Then he jerked up to a sitting position, a pair of icy blue eyes flying open. He looked around for a moment before looking at me. \n \n `` Am I in the hospital?'' He asked me. His voice sounded like he had spent most of his life smoking, but it had a pleasant sound to it. Like the gravel of a grandfather's voice in the middle of a story. \n \n `` Yep.'' Is all I managed to mumble out. He nodded his thanks and swung his legs over the side of the stretcher, flashing me as he stood. I looked down. That was n't even fair. \n \n `` Thanks doc, you ever in my neck of the woods, give me a call okay?'' He said and without another word, he walked his naked ass out of the emergency room and into the cold, winter air. After a moment, I looked back to the nurse. She was sitting in a fetal position in the corner of the room, a little cross on a necklace held before her face as she mumbled her way through a `` Hail Mary''. I turned to the intern, who was still staring out the door the guy had left through. \n \n `` He have any I.D.?'' I asked the kid. He looked at me through vacant green eyes for a moment, before running down the hall and returning a moment later with a wallet. I took it. Inside was five hundred bucks in assorted bills, three credit cards, and a single condom. I shook it a little and a drivers license slid out of a pocket, followed by a handful silver coloured coins the size of dimes. I looked at it. It read: \n \n Stanley Lightbringer. \n \n Aged 66. \n \n Born April 30th. \n \n I looked back to the doors again, seeing only an empty parking lot beyond. Guy looked young for his age.

He's bound to have *something* to say.'' \n \n Suddenly there was a lull, a hush over the entire crowd that made me look around. Cheers erupted all around. I clapped and cheered with everyone as the Dark Lord stepped out onto the stage and took a bow; he was always a polite one. After waving and shaking his bald, green head good-naturedly, he signalled for us to quiet down. After a second or two, all was silent. He placed his wand to his throat and he began, his voice magically amplified. \n \n `` My people,'' he began in that elegant high-pitched voice, `` we've reached an anniversary today that -'' \n \n `` Shut up, *Voldemort*!'' \n \n There were gasps amongst the crowd. To interrupt the good leader, to call him by his *name* - such disrespect - and then everyone turned to the right looking in the air. I did as well, and saw a man with glasses on his face and a receding hairline floating into the air. Flight?! But no one could fly except the Dark Lord... and... \n \n `` Fear not, people!'' came his booming voice. `` I am here to end this reign of terror, to stop this madman -'' \n \n `` Aw, shut up, Potter!'' \n \n Cries came out from all over the crowd, drowning out his voice. I realised this was that idiot Harry Potter singing the same old song, trying to'save us.' How'd he escaped Azkaban this time? I joined in the noise. \n \n `` Just die, you old bastard! No one wants you here! You're not a hero!'' \n \n He sent a red beam of light flying at the Dark Lord. It was deflected by an Expelliarmus and with a Stunning spell, the aging man was sent dropping to the ground. The crowd parted as he fell, until with a great thump, the Boy Who Lived landed on the ground. \n \n `` He's dead!'' someone shouted out. `` He's really dead!'' \n \n Applause erupted.\n"}

He didn ’ t know it was his birthday because he was usually strung out on heroine. He had met a girl a few months prior named Summer. Summer was a fun woman, but she had a 5-year-old son, a dead husband, and an addiction. Summer introduced him to heroine, and the two haven ’ t been apart since. \n \n He lived with his parents. He never moved out after high school. His mother was in prison again. His mother was never sober, which made wrecking vehicles a lot easier. She was in prison for her 7th DUI in the last 15 years. \n \n On his birthday, his dad came to his bedroom door. \n \n “ Hey! It ’ s almost noon. Wake up ” his dad said loudly while knocking on the door. \n \n Jesse groaned. He resented his father for trying to get him to wake up. ‘ Can ’ t he just let me sleep? ’ he thought to himself. \n \n He rolled over to look at his phone. It was 11:53. There were 12 texts from Summer. \n \n “ Come on. Wake up. We need to talk. ” His dad said again. \n \n Twenty minutes later Jesse walked into the kitchen wearing only his boxers and socks. His dad was sitting at the small kitchen table that could hardly fit 2 people, which made dinners challenging when his mother wasn ’ t in prison. \n \n “ I want to tell you something that I haven ’ t told you before, ” his dad said softly. He was silent for a moment before he began again. \n \n “ You were supposed to have a sister. Your mother promised me she would stop doing drugs the first time she was pregnant. I had to work a lot to pay child support and she spent a lot of time alone at the house. She had men come over while I was at work because she was lonely and they brought her drugs, ” he explained. \n \n Jesse thought about his older half brother who turned 28 a few months ago. He hadn ’ t heard from him in 10 years. Jesse wondered if he was still alive. His father was married before he met his mother, and they were poor when he was growing up. ‘ Fuck, we still are poor ’ Jesse thought to himself. \n \n “ I always wondered how life would be different if you had an older sister, ” he said, mostly to himself. “ Let ’ s have Summer and her son over for dinner. Happy Birthday, Son. ” \n \n Jesse forgot today was his birthday.\n"}

It was a good substitute for handcuffs- easy to carry, cheap and cutting into the victim's neck or wrists with just a little bit of movement. \n \n It was a pity, but people did n't seem to realize it was easy enough to slip out of if you put your wrist in a specific position as you were being tied up. \n \n Tyler smiled broadly to himself beneath the black bag tied around his head. He could feel the car rumbling beneath him as it swerved this way and that. \n \n At last, they stopped somewhere. He was dragged out into a light rain and further into some sheltered area- a warehouse by the docks, he guessed, from the smell of saltwater in the air and the patter of rain on zinc roofing. \n \n Someone sat him on a chair and pulled off the bag. \n \n `` Good evening.'' \n \n He blinked for a moment. Let's see... swinging light bulb, check. Thugs with guns, check. Menacing mastermind standing half-hidden in the shadows, check. \n \n Monologue, check. The man was blabbing at him about some kind of masterplan. Money was involved somewhere. Murder too. \n \n ``... all you need is a white cat...'' he murmured to himself. \n \n `` Do n't look so confused.'' the shadowed man said, ignoring his mutters, `` If you co-operate and tell me what I want to know, you wo n't be hurt... much.'' \n \n `` Kill.'' he mumbled. \n \n `` What?'' the shadowed man leaned in. \n \n He sighed and dropped the worried face he'd been keeping fixed up the whole time. `` Kill. Not hurt.'' he said clearly, smiling, `` What kind of wuss are you starting out with a minor threat like that?'' \n \n He'd slipped out of the zipties a few moments ago. He lunged forward in a single fluid motion, snapping into a roll as he grabbed the shadowed man by the neck and used him as an impromptu meat shield. \n \n A few rounds found their targets in his shield but he was already ducking behind a large wooden crate in the shadows. His captive whimpered under his arm. \n \n `` Hush now... if you stay put, I wo n't kill you dead.'' \n \n He leapt aside, sneaking behind one of the thugs nearing his crate and grabbing the man by the neck. There was a crack and he moved away, dancing around the chair he'd been sat on moments before. He picked it up and slammed it into another thug, snapping off the chair leg and stabbing it into the man's vulnerable throat. \n \n He grinned as he rose, tossing the bloodied chair leg away. The last thug was running out of the building. Casually, he picked up a gun from a fallen thug and aimed. \n \n `` And then there were none.'' \n \n The last thug fell with the bang, slumping outside. The rain did not quite disguise the gradually darkening puddle around his form. \n \n He walked behind the wooden crate only to find the man he'd left there trying to crawl away. He stepped on the man's back. \n \n `` You're an amateur are n't you?'' he mused. He lifted the injured man by the collar, dragging him back to the centre of the warehouse. \n \n Without hesitation, he emptied a bullet into the man's shoulder. There was a scream and a splash of red. He stepped on the shoulder, grinding his heel down slightly to the sound of whimpers. \n \n He leaned down, smiling beatifically as he pulled the man up by his tie. \n \n `` Now, this is how you do a proper interrogation...'' \n\n"}

The seemingly endless waiting, the voice of the sassy middle aged receptionist that comes over the intercom every so often, and the hordes of other people waiting there for help with a ticket or license plate or whatever issue they had. \n In the age of smartphones though, the wait always led to hours of texting or playing games, so a few hours on reddit or emulating Pokemon Blue was n't anything I was a stranger to. \n \n Suddenly while I was in the middle of battling a weak Cueball Biker on Cycling Road, a text interrupted my game. A slight wiggle from the notification bar above caught my eye and I being annoyed at the notification barely but obviously obstructing my screen decided to read it. \n \n `` *YOU'RE NEXT*'' \n \n As I read the message, a slight chill went down my back and thinking to every horror movie and game I could think of, came rushing to me. \n It could be a prank, a demon, a murderer. I did not have the number and the area code was from somewhere I was n't accustomed to seeing. Almost immediately after, the intercom shouted my number. I was relieved, the wait was short today. I went up to the front desk and started to voice my complaints, since obviously I had not been going 175 miles an hour in Oregon the day before, seeing as I was in Florida with a beat up old Chevy that could barely hit 80. The front lady did the usual company beat around the bush bullshit, and I, frustrated was told to wait in another room. That's where Hell began. \n \n As I walked into the room I saw 5 other people, about my age, sitting on their call phones. They all had the same phone as I did, a new version of HTC's best gaming phone. Three of them were talking with each other across the small space and two were laughing. I had the urge to know what they were doing, since the noises coming from their phones sounded awesome and I was a bit of a gamer. \n \n So I asked them what game they were playing. \n \n `` Hell'' they all responded simultaneously. That freaked me out a bit, but then I said whatever and checked the app store. \n \n Hell was an `` intense and colorful game of cooperation, tactics and manly spirit!'' \n \n After reading that, I knew the game had to be from Japan. Manly spirit was used a lot in Manga and anime, and I always liked reading stories like that so I downloaded it. After it installed I started the game and as it patched the 5 in the room sighed and started paying each other, like they had some kind of bet going. \n \n I asked them what was going on and they replied that may people had come in and out but none other then them had downloaded the game. I wondered why it was such a big deal and before they said anything, my hands felt an electrical surge. The game was running and I could n't move my hands. The game was started and I was going to be playing whether I wanted to or not. \n \n From an outside perspective, it was a normal RPG, but it required 6 players, each a different class to move out from the starting room. The starting room was like a tavern where all sorts of info could be learned, and the other 5 helped me get up to speed about what they had found out while waiting for me. Many odd rules were in place, including the fact that we had to stick together to do well, and the closer we were to each other in the game, the more powerful our characters would be. The class I chose was the Tank. I love being the focal point of enemy attacks and being able to have a big decision in where we decide to go, so I was happy, but the others had been bickering over classes forever. Soon we got to playing the game and it was a blast. The mechanics were wonderful and the enemies thrilling to battle. We steadily progressed through the stages until we finally got to the last boss. It took all of our best efforts and 30 minutes of our time, but we ended up winning. After that our hands were unglued to the phones and we exchanged numbers and info as friends. But when we tried to leave the room, the intercom voice shouted at us \n \n *'' NO! You can not leave until you beat the final boss! `` * I was confused at that point, the DMV was telling us to beat the final boss to leave? That did n't make any sense whatsoever, so as we started talking about the ludicrous statement, a side door opened. A huge room with armor and weapons from `` Hell'' were all over the room, and a teleport pad like the ones into the boss room awaited us. Feeling nervous, I equipped my endgame gear and grabbed my Archdemon's Fang +7 sword and my Usurper's Righteous Shield, and waited for the other to get ready. Once we were all ready we stepped onto the teleporter and what stood there shook our bones. A 5'7'' 250 lb middle aged woman with long nails and big hair was staring at us. After the archer observed her, a status ailment of sassy was permanently added. This was easily the most horrifying boss we could've encountered, so we maintained our raid positions and attacked. 3 hours off attacking and wailing on this overpowered boss did nothing, and each of us was bombarded with personal insults and name called that almost all of our potions were used up. One by one my friends were annihilated and disintegrated before my eyes. At that moment the boss started to get serious as she pulled out a megaphone. She shouted \n \n *'' NUMBER 357, GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE'' * I was pulled with an unavoidable gravity technique right in front of her, and on my attempts to move I could not. Then she pulled back her hand and was about to slap me when suddenly..... \n \n I shuddered as I sat up in my chair, all seemingly a dream as I walked up to the counter. The real final boss from my dream was sitting in the chair and pointed to a nice looking man with glasses who was about to take my case. As I walked with him to his office I looked behind me, and as I was still sleepy, I could n't tell if what had happened next was real, but the sassy lady from the front pulled out a small knife when she pretended to bend down and looked at me with the evil in her eyes that I could not mistake for anything else but bloodlust. \n \n Stupid Boring DMV just like usual.\n"}

So when I play fetch with the damn dog, I have to unlock all of that shit and relock it behind me so zombies do n't come in and steal it all.

You take out an old bandana from your pocket and wipe down the zombie's mouth in front of you. He opens his mouth, presses his empty gums against your fingers, than quickly pushes away from your skin. He pushes you away with both hands, seemingly disgusted by the taste of your skin. `` You zombies are super rude. Do you know how offensive it is that I'm the only person you do n't want to eat?'' you say. The bandana feels wet and unexpectedly cold in your hand. The dark liquid starts to leak onto your hand. `` Ugh, fuck. You can keep that buddy. You need it more than me,'' you say, wrapping the bandana around the zombies face, cowboy style. His drool no longer drips down on the stage, but soaks into the red bandana. \n \n `` Really though, everything else is actually pretty great. I can take anything I want from neighbors or stores. I'm a vegetarian now, so I do n't have to fight over food with zombies, so I've started gardening.'' The zombie leans his head back, now unable to let the liquid drain from his mouth. He begins gargling the liquid in his throat. `` Hey, shut up. Gardening can be manly. Especially in the apocalypse! Do you know how hard it is to find uninfected fertilizer around here? Really fucking hard. Gardening is awesome and you suck. You especially suck because you're dead. I mean, really man. How the fuck did you get zombified up in the fucking rafters in the high school auditorium and then never fall down? Where is the person that zombified you? Are you the original zombie?

Next destination on the list is Home Depot. Seriously, Home Depot is the most important place when you're the only person alive in the zombie apocalypse. \n \n In the foyer of the school, empty of zombies, you hear the older, dusty security door creak in front of you. It does n't stop you from proceeding forward. Zombie intrusions are n't unfamiliar to you anymore. Except this time, you see a hand sneak through the crack of the door, searching for a light switch. The hand is absolutely covered in really normal, almost clean skin. The fingers do n't even look starved! \n \n Confusing excitement fills you. It's been so long since you've seen a human that's living. Will this be awkward? What do I say? \n \n The hand searches the wall up and down, unable to find anything. You are used to sitting in darkness since all the power went out years ago, so this must be a survivor that stays outside a lot! How exciting! Maybe they went off into the woods like all the movies! Or maybe zombies do n't bother this person either! You can build a life together!

We're getting close.'' \n \n `` Good,'' said Captain Morak, as his eyes focused on the numbers flashing on the display. `` Any response to our hails?'' \n \n `` None yet, sir,'' said the communications officer. `` Results from the long range scans are just coming in.'' \n \n A moment passed in silence, as the officers on the ship's bridge waited for her analysis. \n \n `` Long range scanners show no signs of radio activity, or any electromagnetic communication methods at all,'' she said slowly, her voice drawn out in her confusion. `` Aside from the quantum flux, this system looks inhabited by nothing more advanced than the stone ages.'' \n \n `` Fourteen light years away,'' said the captain, musing out loud. `` There's nothing that would block our sensors from this range, is there?'' \n \n `` Nothing that we could n't otherwise detect,'' responded the communications officer. \n \n `` Let's move into the system itself, then,'' said the captain. `` Emerge from warp at the outer boundaries of the system - let's play this carefully. Any civilization with quantum flux technology must be treated with the utmost caution.'' \n \n The subsequent scans from the outer reaches of the AFX429 star system - nicknamed Quanta by the crew, for the strange readings - did little to resolve the mystery. No satellites were detected, no radio waves, no signs whatsoever of advanced life. \n \n Except for that one bizarre reading, that kept emerging every few minutes from the fourth planet. \n \n The scientists aboard the Nova had spent the last few weeks analyzing this signal, ever since they chanced upon it during a routine exploration mission of a nearby nebula. As the ship grew closer, and the readings more precise, the report said that these readings indicated quantum fluctuations and alterations on an extreme scale. Possibly true teleportation, temporary adjustment of the laws of physics and more might be possible with whatever device created these readings. \n \n And yet, there was no other indication of sentience. \n \n The Nova slipped into orbit, the alcubierre warp engines gently returning space to its normal configuration. Intense surface scans began, and the crew discussion intensified as it was revealed that the planet did have sentient life. However, it was too primitive to show on the scanners - they were pre-industrial. The most advanced technology was simple metal-working, in the fashion of ancient blacksmiths. \n \n The strange readings continued to occur, and primarily were detected in population centers. Captain Morak decided that an away team was necessary, for further investigations. Clearly, this technology defied ordinary scanning practices. \n \n A score of nano-bots was released on a mid-sized town, instructed to analyze the biology of the species, as well as to copy the language centers of several subject brains - harmlessly, of course - so as to upload any relevant information into the Nova's main computer. A quick trip to the med-bay, some surgical alteration, and the translation matrix implanted in their brains updated with the new language, and the team was ready. \n \n The shuttle was cloaked by the best holographic equipment available, and they made their way to the surface. \n \n The doors opened, and a complex wash of scents came in on the spring air, carrying the perfume of flowers, trees, and open fields, along with the sounds and smells of the town. \n \n `` I've never been anywhere so primitive,'' said science officer Telise, gazing about in fascination. `` I mean, other than undeveloped planets, of course.'' \n \n `` It's strange,'' said Captain Morak. `` Such a tiny moment in a civilization's history, that slice between its emergence into sentience and its emergence into space. It's quite lucky for us, to be able to see it.'' \n \n Telise laughed, a sound that carried well in the unrestricted air. `` Every moment is a tiny slice of time! It's just unusual for us, because long range scanners ca n't differentiate civilization at this stage from previous ones, that's all. But let's get on to what they *were* able to find...'' \n \n She pulled out a handheld scanner, calibrated in these last few days to detect the quantum fluctuations. It was hardly ten seconds before it buzzed quietly, a small indicator pointing in the direction that the signal originated. \n \n `` This signal is very weak,'' Telise said, `` But quite close, and above ground.'' \n \n She pointed at a house a half kilometer away. `` Around there, I'd say.'' \n \n Captain Morak nodded and they walked towards the house carefully and unobtrusively. The surgical alterations and translation matrix were good, but virtually all cooperative species were quite good at detecting intruders. The subtleties of body language and tone were hard to mimic. \n \n The sensor buzzed twice more, as the pair approached the house, and led them to the backyard. There, they saw a woman playing with her young daughter. They drew close, listening to the aliens, and watching for another reading. \n \n `` Aera, Aera! Silly girl, you have to *practice*! How else will you get accepted?'' scolded the mother, in a loving tone. \n \n `` But Mom, ca n't I just practice with flowers?'' the girl - Aera, presumably - said, her voice wistful. \n \n `` You are already excellent with the flowers,'' the mother sighed. `` And that is wonderful, but no Academy is going to accept you because you can make pretty flowers! Fine control of movement is far more impressive. Show me what you've learned, Aera.'' \n \n The girl sighed, and Telise's eyes started wandering elsewhere, trying to determine where the signals could be coming from, but the sensor had remained quiet during the conversation. \n \n The girl's hands waved in the air for a moment, and the away team could just barely hear that she was muttering something to herself. They shared a private smile, thinking this a common feature of teenage defiance between their species, when Telise jumped in surprise, looking at the sensor. \n \n `` Level with us, in the direction of the girl, 5.4 meters away...'' she said, her eyes going wide. `` That's the girl, Aera.'' \n \n `` Telise...'' Captain Morak said, his voice tight with some emotion she'd never heard in him before. `` Telise, look away from the damned scanner. Look at what she's doing.'' \n \n Her eyes turned back to the field, and she saw something impossible. Aera held her hands in front of her body, face scrunched in concentration, as a mid-sized boulder lifted higher and higher into the air. \n \n `` S... sir, the signal's getting stronger,'' Telise said, desperately going back to her readings out of habit. `` And it's also becoming more sporadic.'' \n \n `` Would n't that mean...?'' Captain Morak started to say, but he was cut off. \n \n The boulder dropped with a thud, and Aera gasped for breath. \n \n She was n't the only one who needed a moment.\n"}

It comes to me in bits and pieces, dream like. A vague smell. A loud scream. A smirk in the dark. \n \n I get out of bed and walk slowly towards my closet. I change out of my soiled clothes and into something fresh. I've got to find the source of the scream. Could of been a child. Or a woman. It's hard to tell, and the fleeting glimpse never tells the whole story. \n \n I move my hand in front of me and concentrate on the scream. There is the usual faint blue light I see. I turn in a circle and it gets dimmer. I head in the opposite direction. \n \n I continue to follow the blue light, it gets stronger without getting brighter. More vivid. The Other always likes to play it close to home. I've got to get there before the police do. A complication I do n't want. \n \n I almost lose my way, but the blue light is never wrong. I trail it up to a building, a flight of stairs, and into an old apartment. The smell from my dream hits me. It's shit. It's a small apartment. One door is open, leading to the bathroom. The other is closed, probably to a bedroom. I hold my hand out, and the blue light glows intensely. Behind the closed door. \n \n I'm nervous. This never goes well. What else can I do? I'm the only one who can stop what the Other has done. I gather myself and open the door to the horror that's inside. \n \n The girl is cut and bleeding. She's tied to a chair that is facing the door. She's conscious; she sees me and screams. It comes out as a muffle and I see a blood stained white cloth shoved in her mouth. She starts gagging and coughing as the cloth wedges itself further in her mouth. \n \n I approach her and she tries to get away, panic fueled eyes fluttering over me. I do n't say anything to calm her. Nothing I can say will calm her. I move around the chair and untie her. I back away and say a single word, `` Go.'' \n \n She stumbles and drops to the ground. She quickly crawls away, stands with the help of the door frame and runs. A few seconds later, I hear her screaming. This time, it's loud and piercing. The same one from my dream. \n \n I quickly leave. I make my way home -- using the power exhausts me. The more I use, the more I feel like sleeping. I find myself sleeping more and more lately. I do n't understand it. It only came to me a few weeks ago. I hope I can find the Other before my power runs out. If it runs out. \n \n I see my bed and plop into it gratefully. Within moments I'm asleep. \n \n ~~__________________~~ \n \n The Other wakes. He's pleased. He looks around Hero Boys apartment and stretches contentedly. What happens when Hero Boy does n't wake up? Will The Other get his powers? He hopes so. That'd be fun. Until then, he'll just have to focus on making Hero Boy tired. Time to find the girl again.

It was simple, gratifying, free at first. Out on the open road with nothing but a simple horse to care for, he felt free for the first time in his life. \n \n However, it was nothing but a temporary escape at best- how can one truly escape himself? \n \n He saw great things on the road, beautiful and terrible.

Keep looking around and trying everything.

We no longer cared where you were from or where you worked. We cared about how you'd made it through alive when so many others had n't. But I hated that question. \n \n *'' I was at work when it first started...'' * I answered. \n \n Spring rain had been tapping on the windows as I worked. Just a short shower; it would pass soon. On the news, we heard about the infection spreading through the state. It seemed to drive people mad. The anchor on CNN was saying that Sacramento had been quarantined now and that nobody could get in touch with the Governor or anyone else in the Capitol. \n \n It had seemed so far away until that moment. I took a break from my work; I'd been trying not to stare at the computer screen for such long periods of time. I grabbed a bottle of water and looked out the window. In the parking lot, a mob of disheveled people were clustered around a car. They pounded on the windows, but they were n't even trying to door handles. The windshield shattered, and three of them climbed onto the hood. They crawled through the broken glass, pulled out the driver, and tore out his throat as I watched. \n \n *'' As soon as I realized what was happening, I raced home...'' * \n \n I'd never been so thankful to own a motorcycle. The interstate was jam-packed with cars, so close together that I could n't go between them. I just drove through the grassy median; bumpy, but much faster. Some people were just standing on the shoulder, waiting for traffic to clear. Some of them were nursing bleeding wounds, wrapped in whatever towel or t-shirt they could find. Some of them were already turning. \n \n `` *When I got there, I just grabbed some of my belongings... *'' \n \n `` Maria!'' I shouted as I burst through the door. `` We need to go. There's something happening!'' In the living room, the TV was on, and I could hear some of the anchors chattering about the infection. `` Maria?'' I called out again. *Where was she? * \n \n The back door was open, banging lightly against the frame as it blew in the breeze. I moved to close it, and caught a glimpse of long, black hair out the window in the backyard. I followed her out. \n \n `` Maria!'' I shouted to her. She turned, and I saw the blood dribbling down her chin. If it were n't for that, she would have looked exactly the same as that first day we met, all those years ago. But she growled like a vicious dog and took off running in my direction. I scrambled back inside and closed the door behind me. She thumped against it like a bird running into a clear window. I raced to the living room closet and grabbed my gun from the highest shelf. Maria had n't wanted to have one in the home; she was afraid of them. She was worried that Thomas might find it. \n \n I returned to the back door holding the weapon in front of me. `` Maria...'' I said slowly. There was a growl from outside. I opened a window and tried to talk to her through the screen. `` Maria, I need you to...'' \n \n She launched herself through the window at me, hands grasping and clawing at the air. She caught hold of my shirt sleeve until I ripped it from her vice-like grasp. Her eyes were cold and dead, like a shark's. She managed to climb through the opening and advanced. Her front of her yellow dress was stained with gore. My hands shook as I raised the gun and pulled the trigger; her body crumpled to the linoleum. \n \n I lowered the gun and took a deep breath. My hands were shaking so much that I thought I might drop the pistol. But the shot had attracted some unwelcome attention. I heard a series of groans from the neighbor's yard, and I saw that part of the fence had been torn down. That must be how they got to Maria. It would only be a matter of time before they found me too. \n \n I slammed the door shut and ran up to Thomas's room. Hopefully Maria had already picked him up from kindergarten. \n \n His door was closed. \n \n I knocked first. I'd never done that before entering my son's room. I do n't know why I did it. \n \n A groan answered from the other side. \n \n `` Thomas?'' I called out. The groan was louder this time. My voice broke as I called his name again. The door rattled, and there was another groan. \n \n I could n't look. Shooting my wife was enough for me. I left him there. And it was the hardest thing I'd ever done. I'd probably killed hundreds of zombies in my years on the mountain, but *not* killing one is the one thing that weighs on my soul. \n \n `` *and as soon as I had the supplies I needed, I just left town.

The white light glints off of something silver, a gun. Two sit across from one another, a young girl, barely fifteen yet, she misses most of her hair and she looks so frail, her hospital gown hanging off one of her shoulders. Her eyes, perhaps filled with some form of hope of beating her disease at some point, are now bloodshot and only showing a look of disbelief. Hours before they told her she had less time than they had thought. Three months they had said, and from the looks of her now it would be much shorter. She kept her eyes down, looking at the missing limb of her'friend'. She had never caught his name, though she knew he was as willing as she to play this game. He was in better health, though still had an expiration date. That he had never shared, that he would never share. His expiration was tonight. He would be damned if it was n't him that got that bullet. \n \n Both patients had agreed that they would take the blame if the other was shot. Why the boy had only acquired one bullet was beyond her, but nevertheless she hoped it went into her head. She was done with this sickness, she was done with it controlling everything. She had to drop out of high school, she lost all her friends, her hair, her art. The girl had been accepted to one of the most prestigious art schools in the country and here she was now, perched on a hospital bed with a gun digging into her temple. \n \n Times had changed and so had she. \n \n The boy looked up at her, his eyes softening slightly. \n \n `` You're not going to look?'' he breathed, his finger hesitant on the trigger. The girl barely nodded, her body letting off small shivers that turned into flinches of pain. The boy took a deep breath, coughing quietly into his arm before pulling the trigger, it letting of a click the echoed in the room for ages before they both came back from shock. \n \n Talking about doing something is different than actually doing it. \n \n The boy reached over and placed the gun in the girl's lap. She picked it up with a struggle, her thin wrists looking as if they might break from the sheer weight of it, though it was n't even that heavy. At least it should n't of been. She reached over, placing it to the boys temple, as he had to her. He locked eyes with her, as if assuring her it would be alright. She pulled the trigger. It clicked, just as it had before. The boy hissed, gripping the wheels of his chair as if in anger. \n \n He took the gun back and placed it to her head, pulling the trigger without even a moments hesitation, a moment to assure the girl still wanted to go along with it. It clicked. She took the gun back. No more games. She placed it to his temple and she caught a glimpse of a smile as she pulled the trigger, it giving off a bang as blood splattered across the once clean floor. She dropped the gun, it giving off another bang. She screamed, tears streaming down her cheeks. This is not what she had planned, this is not what she had thought would happen. She needed to get out. \n \n She looked down at the gun, a moment of calm coming over her. She slipped from her bed, immediately falling to her knees. She grabbed at the wheel chair for stability, barely able to hold her own weight as she reached for the gun, grabbing it up in the swiftest movement she had done in months. The hospital door swung open, nurses and security storming in in a blur, they all pausing in the doorway, taking in the scene. \n \n The girl shuffled away, time seeming to freeze for everyone else. It all clicked for them then as they rushed in, running towards the boy and her, yelling out orders, disbelief and confusion coming from their seemingly angry voices. Security came towards her, though not quick enough. Back pressed against the very edges of the room she raised the gun to her temple and pulled the trigger. \n\n"}

In seconds, the notes bounced of the tiles walls, reflecting sound through the empty space. His voice rattled through my veins, and I began to shake. Then he stopped. I raised my eyebrows and stared at him. \n \n `` Think of another,'' he said. \n \n So I did. Sure enough, the man began playing the song I was thinking of. His rough voice rang through my ears. I continued to stare in disbelief. \n \n `` Come here, son,'' he said, gesturing for me to sit on the ground. \n \n I sat next to him. His eyes were soft. As I looked deeper, they reminded me of my mother's. The wrinkles on his face began to smooth. His hair lightened, flowing into bouncy curls. I saw my mom. I had n't seen her in years. My eyes filled with tears as she held my hand. \n \n I wiped the tears from my eyes. `` Mom --'' I stammered. But she was n't there anymore. He sat next to me gripping my hand. His nails dug deep into my skin as I tried to pull away, screaming. No one was there to hear me. \n \n He tugged me to the ground and whispered into my ear. `` Do you want to know a secret?''

Love just looks like it's not in the cards for me, then again what is? \n \n The next few weeks at work was everyone congratulating me. I took it all with numbness, assuming their thinly veiled reasoning behind speaking to me. Most people in the office never bothered saying a word until I hit lotto. \n \n I wrapped up my last month before just deciding to quit. Mail carrying was just another mundane aspect to my days. Every day the same route, the same faces. I figured I'd have more adventure sitting at home running errands and chores. \n \n That too, grew tired. \n \n I spent a sliver of my fortunes on a revolver. I felt no desire to live on. It's not so much a sense of despair as it is a lack of interest. The sadness is long gone. When the numbness to everything sets in is where it really becomes a problem. I decided to give it one go. I chambered a round and spun the barrel. A few last thoughts crossed my mind, nothing too meaningful anymore. Things like my old highschool crush, the college attempt at love that wound up cheating, missing friends. I pulled the trigger... \n \n Click. \n \n Unless I just blew my brains out and this is death, nothing happened. Even winning a game of Russian roulette with myself still feels like a loss. I set the gun down and poured myself a glass of whiskey. I feel asleep on the recliner by the fireplace. Rock bottom felt like it had been hit. \n \n Over the course of the next few weeks an itch started growing to do something with all my free time. I began buying gifts for some pen pals I have made over the years, many from distant foreign lands. These gifts were met with much gratitude and appreciation. One of those friends however, sent nothing back. She was always a frequent sender so this struck me as odd. \n \n I decided to go visit her in person as she requested many times in the past except I never had the money. That no longer being an issue, I could easily do so now. \n \n I took the next flight I could to Paris. Nothing but me and a small suitcase of some clothes. After touchdown it was a smooth taxi ride down to her house. A nice little flat that looks just like the pictures she used to send me. \n \n I knocked a couple times but was n't answered. I decided to give the handle a little turn. To my surprise the door was unlocked. I cracked it open and called her name. Still no answer. I figured she was out so I went in and sat on her couch for a couple hours just waiting in hopes to see her come home surprised. \n \n Such time never came. \n \n I got up and quietly roamed the house a bit, being sure not to startle her if she were home. \n \n I made my way down a hallway to where I assumes her bedroom would be based off the pictures. I opened the door slowly and saw her laying down sleeping, which would explain her not answering. After taking a couple steps closer I saw that her sleep was more than just that. My gift was laying next to her along with a letter she wrote and an open bottle of prescription pills, about half empty on the nightstand next to her. \n \n My eyes welled and breathing became difficult. My shaking hands picked up the letter and it read...'' I have waited for years. If you never come you will never read this and the police will never understand.'' \n \n By the end of those two short sentences, the paper was wet and ripping. \n \n My one chance at love is gone. At the top she always dates her letters, this one was dated as today. I missed her by hours. \n \n Whatever was alive in me after everything in my life was now dead. \n \n I laid down next to her and finished off what was left of the pills and held her until I too fell asleep to join her.\n"}

The shadows in this place left only small hints of her face showing. \n \n But the shadows were this place. \n \n I stood transfixed, staring at one of the many trees in this strange forest. It's shadow overlapped others to somehow create a solid rock. \n \n I walked a few steps to my right, trying to make sense of it. Now it appeared that it was the tree that was a shadow, cast flat onto the ground from the rock. \n \n What in God's name? \n \n As far as I could tell, we were in a forest made of nothingness, where everything was somehow a... dark reflection of itself. \n \n I swallowed hard. I guess it all depended on your perspective. \n \n `` Wha-what is this place?'' I asked, panic making me stutter slightly. \n \n `` This is not a place,'' the cowled woman spoke, `` This is an idea. An idea made of ideas. An idea that gives birth to many more. And somehow, for some reason, you have come here.'' \n \n I looked down at my hand, and was terrified to see the flames were still blazing, consuming me. Why did I feel no pain? \n \n `` I... remember,'' I said, testing out the words. Words sounded hollow here. Out of place. `` I remember, they had told me that I was unclean. That only fire would cleanse me.'' \n \n The cowled woman nodded. `` They have dangerous ideas. Ideas that do not fit well together. There is no rhyme or reason to them. Only hatred.'' \n \n As the old woman spoke the word hatred, the shadows tightened, like loosely woven cloth being pulled from the last thread. \n \n We were now in a bleak cage, with jagged edges. I got the feeling that it was slowly tightening, closing in on us. \n \n I could n't feel anything, and yet, I felt cold. Even on fire, I felt cold. I looked into her deep, grey eyes. There was no pity in them... but there was no malice either. \n \n `` Am I dead?'' I asked. I knew the answer, but still, I had to hear it. \n \n The woman stepped closer to me, the shadow she cast changing the others as it moved with her. They rearranged themselves, shifting into different patterns and dimensions. \n \n I took in my new surroundings. We were inside a large chamber with pillars that stretched up to a vast dome. It almost looked like a church. Intricate patterns shifted and moved against the surfaces. \n \n `` You are nothing,'' she said, `` but an idea now. An idea that burned so bright in you that it survived inside this place. So much a part of you, that it took much of you here with it.'' \n \n `` Freedom,'' I spoke. As I did, the shadows once again shifted, as if the word itself moved them. We now stood on the edge of a gentle lake. A shadow sun reflected across the deep blackness of the water. \n \n This place... it took my fear away. \n \n I looked down at my hands. No fire. They were unmarked. I smiled. \n \n `` I know why you have come here now. You could not change their minds on that world,'' the woman smiled, `` But you may be able to make a difference in this one. And if you do, it will spread.'' \n \n `` How?'' I said, noticing that I did n't need to move my lips anymore to do so. \n \n `` You must fight the ideas. The ones that unbalance this place, and stifle it's growth. You still cary with you the parts that make you human. This will allow you to do the things that my people and I can not.

Still, he struggled to accept it. \n \n `` You live more than three times as long as anyone from my species,'' he said to me one night. `` I just do n't get it.'' \n \n I looked up at his small centaur frame standing in my doorway. `` What do n't you get?'' I asked. \n \n `` Your species lives three times as long as mine...'' he said, trying to find the right words. `` I just...'' \n \n `` It's okay, just say it,'' I said with my kindest look on my face. \n \n `` What's wrong with your species?'' he finally asked. \n \n Now it was my turn to be shocked. Of all the things to ask! I was insulted, certainly, but I reminded myself that his own culture did n't have the concept of tact. At least he was trying. \n \n He saw the look on my face and I could see him shift his weight as though he was preparing for me to lunge at him. I closed my eyes and turned away from him. I did n't want him to think I was going to attack. I never knew a \n Saiemptalliean to back down from a fight especially one about honor. \n \n `` D'jargo,'' I said after a moment, `` Come in here and take a seat. I want to understand what you mean.'' \n \n The Saiemptalliean relaxed and walked into my room. He seemed a little wary, but came to sit beside me on the bed. I took a breath and said, `` You said you think there is something'wrong' with my species. Would you care to elaborate?'' \n \n He looked at me and took a breath. `` My species was one of the longest lived we had ever come across. Most Alliance species look to us because we have the wisdom that comes from long life. We figured out how to get along because we knew we had to live together. Fights may be something we do regularly, but your species' wars take this to a level no one else can even comprehend.'' \n \n `` Yes,'' I said with a bit of a laugh, `` We have a hard time letting things go.'' \n \n `` Stubbornness is one thing,'' he said sharply, `` But your species just seems...'' \n \n `` Barbaric?'' I offered. \n \n D'jargo cocked his head to the side in confusion, so I looked up the translation of the word. He laughed, saying `` Your language has a word for everything.'' \n \n I laughed too. `` My species is pretty ingenious. Maybe that's why we have n't killed ourselves yet.'' \n \n The Saiemptalliean sobered at that. `` I do n't understand why your species is like that. \n \n `` Leslie,'' he continued, `` My own people figured out long ago that our long lives mean we have to live with the consequences of our actions. The ch'thuDar-ei live only half as long as my species. They do n't have to live with their actions very long.'' \n \n `` True,'' I said, `` But they have an overmind that has to live with their actions.'' \n \n `` It's not the same,'' D'jargo shook his head. `` The overmind does n't have the same day to day life that we do.'' \n \n I looked him square in his eye. `` You're stalling. What is it you want to say?'' \n \n He gave a sound I had learned was a sigh and said `` If your species lives three times as long as mine, why do so many struggle to find peace?'' \n \n It was my turn to be somber. `` We have been asking ourselves that for as long as we can remember.''\n"}

I had the ability to shunt between worlds, a sort of interdimensional", "human": "It's been a while now since I discovered that I was different. I had the ability to shunt between worlds, a sort of interdimensional hop between possibilities. The rifts open and close as they please, I do n't control them. But 9 months ago, I was in a dark place, angry at the world and everyone around me. I went to bed, shaking off the disappointments of another daily grind. Woken by a pale, pastel-blue light, I vaguely remember inspecting it, thinking it was a dream. It rippled slightly in the draft, bringing with it a faint scent of plantlife. In a haze of desperation, tiredness and pure unbridled curiosity, I hurled myself through the aperture into another world. \n \n This one had minimal difference, I soon discovered. I thought it another dream, until I realized that I was bleeding. Dreams do n't bleed. Hauling myself out of bed and getting ready, I managed to chronicle two things about this apparent new world. \n \n 1 ) The leaves were red. \n \n 2 ) I was currently floating. \n \n Not like that bullshit in the movies, where Superman or whatever hovers gracefully around the heads of an adoring fanbase. Trying to move around in this world was like trying to climb up a waterslide. Nothing gave purchase, and the few things that I was able to grab onto gave me no leverage. \n \n I hovered like this for some time, bumping into things, filling the virgin air of this brand new universe with fresh profanities, and trying various attempts at self-harm in the desperate hope that this was still a dream. Perhaps half an hour later, another rift opened, slicing blue light into the air. I found traction on a floating picture frame and *jumped*, the first time I had felt real control in this strange new world. Gliding through the rift, I immediately felt my body right itself under gravity's confines again, and was met with yet another painful welcome. \n \n It continued on like this for some time, me discovering the occasionally frustrating and sometimes disturbing parameters of all these universes. Some were unnerving, some were barely changed from my'orginal' universe, and still others were just... strange. Over the course of my travels, I discovered how to open the rifts at will, concentrating for a couple of seconds and being greeted by that familiar pale blue glow again. It was n't too hard to find worlds I could sleep in, that had agreeable inhabitants or just seemed empty. Some were dangerous, of course, and I spent too many nights cold, alone, and shivering in fear of some eight-legged monstrosity with three too many eyes. But it was nothing if not exciting, and I came to live for the pleasure of the jump, and the sweet new scent of discovering and exploring a brand new universe. \n \n I shifted once more, saying goodbye to a world where it appeared to rain green, and where the dogs grew four eyes. When first falling out of this rift, to an uninviting welcome and the intense displeasure of a stray cat, I was convinced that this was yet another world whose inhabitants mirrored mine, if not for the presence of the angelic choir, or the wings now flitting lazily behind the cat. Having mused to myself that the leaves seemed unnaturally red, I opened the door and stepped into paradise. \n \n That is, I stepped into what *looked* like paradise. \n \n Sure, the floor was clouds and the gates were pearly, and you could look up and see winged beings flitting across the sky. But something felt... off about this one, a strange sense of danger that I could not place. It was at that moment that I looked behind me to take stock of my surroundings, and my shadow did not follow me. It instead stopped where it was, and slowly turned its head to look at me. Which of course is when I noticed the mountains of white piled in the distance were composed of skulls. I then noticed the mass of black seeping towards me, oozing across the landscape like blood. Heading straight for me. Jolted by this revelation, I promptly screamed, in a brave battle cry against the forces of darkness corrupting this seeming utopia. I then commenced a tactical retreat, obviously with the intent of coming back to this place at a later date, with a full company of reinforcements. I was still howling a fearsome battle cry when the rift opened and I emerged into... \n \n Into... \n \n Well. \n \n A hellish pastiche of crimson and orange bloomed before me, and even as the howling of the wraiths faded with the rift's passing I became aware of the stifling heat pervading the air. Columns of flame leapt up before me, and the howling of something unknown to man or beast screamed down from atop a pillar of- \n \n Nah. I was out of there, I'm not stupid, just naive. Even I know that when you open a portal to Hell, you get out. \n \n I emerged scowling, and I spent a few seconds removing the ash from my boots and the sweat beads from my skin, before looking around. Nothing had tried to kill me in those precious moments, so I assumed that it could n't be that bad at all now, could it? \n \n Yeah, should probably have known better than to say shit like that. \n \n It was a dark rocky outcropping, just like the ones you'd find on a tour to the Grand Canyon, a jagged piece of obsidian-black rock that jutted out from... \n \n Uh. \n \n The dark rock seemed to stretch on forever in one direction, looping off into the black unknown. And at the end of the rock was eternity. I know it sounds over-dramatic, but really. You had to see it for yourself. The endless abyss, broken only by the sharp twinkle of a star, gaped open ahead of me. It was awe-inspiring, sanity-defying, more incredibly *huge* than anything I had seen in 8 months of world hopping, and it was a damn fine place to take a nap. Because when you've been chased by shadow monsters and opened a portal to hell on the same day, making camp on the edge of a bottomless chasm of cosmos does n't seem too bad. \n \n That's when a massive claw closed around me, and dragged me an indeterminable distance before jolting to a stop right before an endless set of jaws. Really, when I have to use both `` indeterminable'' and `` endless'' in the same sentence, I probably should n't be here anyway. \n \n Fuck. \n \n I tried to summon another rift, but found myself suffocated when I tried to do so, a presence closing around my mind and holding it until I screamed, in pain and terror. \n \n It stopped. \n \n I began to get a very real, very scary sense that something was watching me. I approached this *thing*, the only monster capable of stopping my ability from occurring, with the utmost discretion and discipline. \n \n `` Hello?'' \n \n A harsh laugh came rolling back after a minute of silence, which made me feel very, very small indeed. \n \n `` And you had the *audacity* to think that you could do this? That you could hop between the Realms of the Living, tearing up plans that took longer to conceive than your mortal life could even *think of? *'' The last parts came out in a bellow, a grating, raspy yet incredibly deep voice that just made me feel way, way out of my depth. \n \n `` You have used this power irresponsibly, mortal, and now you have reached the End of All Things. You will die in the Outworld, alone and universes away from what you know. I will make it quick.'' \n \n I tried to scream, but was again blocked, trapped like a prisoner in my own body by this immensely powerful creature. It lifted me again, and I vaguely got the impression of a massive maw before I began to plummet into the infinite darkness. I got the sense that air *should* be rushing by me, but it was n't \n \n I was going... \n \n going... \n \n Gone.\n"}

We are the people who are ever criticizing ourselves, ever seeking to improve ourselves and ever seeking to make a more perfect union. \n \n While I value material things in life, I have a nice house and I have a business. I am successful and I participate in and give back to my community. I have served as a mayor of Oakland in California. I have worked to attempt to improve life for all of those in that glorious city. I curtailed the intrusiveness of the police while reducing crime. I cleaned up the city and grew jobs. \n \n And after I left working as mayor, I helped fund the desalinization plant that makes East Bay Municipal Utility District no longer dependent on increasingly erratic winter snow pack. I then also helped fund the complete switch over of the San Francisco Bay Area to renewable energy sources through the construction of giant solar farms outside of Reno, Nevada with power storage for night time and winter use. Finally, I helped revamp BART in the bay area through my financial insight and negotiating abilities: BART is now a fully automated, free maglev system allowing for people to come and go as they need in more stops than ever before. \n \n None of these benefited me financially: I had sufficient funds already to live a happy, comfortable life and whatever I earned in excess I always donated to causes, schools, and individuals in need. I ask for nothing in return. \n \n With all of my experience, I look upon the nation as a whole and I an concerned. I am concerned for the direction of the country. I am concerned about the actions of our previous President upon the world stage. I am concerned for the common American. \n \n I will not make grand announcements that we need to make America great again. That is tired nonsense. America IS great! No one should ever disparage that. \n \n Since the beginning, since the Founding, since our Forefathers brought forth this great nation, we have said we are seeking a'More Perfect Union.' And that, my friends, my fellow Americans, is my sole goal. I wish to dedicate my run for the Presidency for the goal, the dream, of creating a more perfect Union. \n \n I believe we can strive towards that glorious ideal, one of a nation of fairness and rights, of opportunity and hope, of being the Leader of the Free world, and protector of human rights of any sort of Human. \n \n Over the course of the campaign ahead, I will explain my ideas, my ideals, my goals and the reverence I have for our great nation and its glorious future. \n \n Today, this day, I begin. We begin.

We had talked about it and readied for it as much as we could. But I was still greedy. \n \n I dreamed of her all night, and held her so tight. But when I awoke, I was alone.\n"}

The opposing party was quick to bring up that entire government was inherently Roman, although with a couple changes. I took a sip of my coffee as I began to finish up my reports. \n \n A man sat down next to me. I continued typing, not paying him any heed, occasionally taking swigs. \n \n He said something that I could n't quite understand. I took out my headphones. `` What?'' \n \n `` Stupid political bullshit going on huh?'' He repeated. \n \n I shrugged. `` Not really. I think it's quite nice to take into account those who do n't follow Jupiter and... whoever else is with him. We're becoming a more atheistic society and it's great to see the government conform to it.'' \n \n He laughed. His grey tank top which clung to his body and his short blonde hair which was incredibly wet, bounced with his laugh. On his right tricep was a tattoo, a laurel crown surrounding the letters SPQR. `` We've had these traditions for two millennia and the've been doing just fine.'' \n \n `` The traditions you celebrate now are not similar to those at the beginning.'' I turned back to my laptop. My left hand started to finger my pendant. `` May I remind you that Latin is a dead language.'' \n \n His face when solemn. He was speechless for a moment, trying to think up a response. He then noticed my necklace. `` May I remind you that you have a dead god.'' \n \n My hand froze. I probably should've seen that coming. I had a habit of fidgeting with the necklace when I was a bit agitated. It always drew attention. \n \n `` Yeah that got you to shut up.'' \n \n `` I was n't the one who started this conversation.'' \n \n `` And I was n't the one who started shitting on another's religion.'' \n \n `` I was simply pointing out that no matter what, things change. If you'd like I could've said early Greek is dead too.'' I closed my laptop and stood up. \n \n He clenched his jaw. `` One thing has n't changed though, and that's Christianity is still under the foot of Rome.''\n"}

The vets in our platoon call what im going through the `` Newbie blues''. Gutierrez is n't handling it well at all and was taken to medical when we got back to base. Nothing major happened. We ran into some local farmers or whatever. They gave us some food and water in exchange for some first aid supplies. I was leery to accept but my CO assured me that they were `` legit''. The food was actually pretty good. `` as long as i do n't ask what is it i'd be OK''. So far the most unnerving this is having to check for anything that can leap out at me while i'm taking a piss.

That same night is when i took my first life in the defense of the freedoms and ideals of my country. God it sounds almost silly now. I used to feel that terror and adrenaline rush when a mortar struck yet now i hardly even react except for the initial impact and explosion. \n \n Gutierrez is a lost cause. the poor bastard hits the dirt at the sound of anything louder then a twig snapping.

They caused the pages yellowed from age to darken slightly. He closed the journal. The charred edges and dried blood on the cover still caused him so much pain. He would never forget the day the 2 men in dress uniform rang his doorbell. He knew what they were going to say before they said a word. It was evident in their facial expression and body language. He snapped back to the present and walked to the living room where he picked up the phone and dialed. \n \n `` Hello is this Alonzo Gutierrez? My name is John Burke.

Shelly Henkle could only think about Jason Brown and how much she wanted to run her hands through his longish, slightly-curled dirty-blonde hair. A week later during an Algebra test, I yelled at her to just ask him out already. The whole class was stunned. Being a middle child, I was fairly adept at lying and fabricated a barely passable Sherlockian story about the obvious signs of her crush on Jason. They got married after high school, moved to the suburbs and had two kids. \n \n Like any teenager with power beyond their wildest dreams, I used it to my advantage. I found if I focused my mind, I could hone in on one person and drown out the rest. Timing and networking quickly became necessary skills, ones I learned to master. By the end of high school I had mastered my gift and felt on top of the world. Unfettered access to peoples' innermost thoughts and desires opened up the world to me. In college, I met privately with professors to learn their secrets and become a trust confidant. I dated some of the most profoundly interesting girls as well as the most attractive. Every guy I met wanted to be my friend and I had VIP access to any party I wanted. After graduating college I found myself an extremely well paying job in mergers and acquisitions. \n \n But my happiness was short-lived. While I had learned to control my gift to some extent, drowning out the city was nearly impossible. Screams of the homeless echoed down abandoned alleys. Cries of fatherless children playing gangster on the streets broke my heart nightly. The nightly existential crisis of hookers drove me to the brink of insanity. Sleep was nearly impossible. After a year, I had filled my coffers plenty and decided to move to the mountains, somewhere quiet. Many people think their coworkers like them, I had the rare pleasure of knowing how much they actually did. On the drive to Wyoming, for the first time in a little over two decades, I found peace. \n \n My cabin was small, but well furnished. During the day I hiked around the area, taking pictures of anything that caught my eye and at night I read by the fireplace. Everything could not have been better. I slept deeply each night and was constantly lost in my own thoughts. For six months, I was in heaven. That was before I heard the voice. \n \n Sun shot proudly through the openings in the trees and crisp cool mountain air filled my nostrils as I hiked to my rock. I found it my second week while trying to find a good vantage point. The rock protruded from the earth like a throne and had one of the best views of the sunrise. Because of the early morning wake-up required to catch the sunrise, I limited myself to only going once a week. As I unpacked my book thermos of coffee, I heard it. \n \n Sometimes, when it's deathly quiet and you're by yourself alone in the woods, you feel something move just beyond your field of vision. Sometimes, you hear your name whispered in hushed tones behind your back. You tell yourself your mind is playing tricks on you, that it was a deer or squirrel in the forest. You tell yourself you're acting childish and berate yourself for such an irrational fear. Yet, your guard is heightened and you are the tiniest bit more on guard. I think it's an evolutionary trait from before recorded time, before anything dared challenge our might as a race. \n \n Most of the time when I hear people's thoughts, I hear them from where the person is standing. Their voice in my head matches their speaking voice. This time, however, none of that was true. \n \n *Devour... you whole* \n \n The voice was deep, but not alone. Shrieks I had only heard from the maddest of street denizens reverberated against empty chasms beneath my feet. When I read minds I can almost feel your brain in my grasp while I search for what I need. Now, I tried to search for what the voice desired. As I tried to dig deeper, I suddenly realized it. I was n't just searching the voice for answers, it was also searching me.\n"}

Fortunately for prairie dogs, however, they do n't sleep in bunk beds. \n \n `` Do you have ANY idea what time it is??''

Sarge was being extra Sargey today... \n \n I tried to gather my senses as best I could while scrambling to get a shred of clothing on before the company moved out. It was the morning of the big day today... the final push into German territory. We had finally gained our footing back, and for the past several months we have made ever-increasing strides towards ending this God-forsaken mess of a war. \n \n *No time to think. These laces wo n't lace themselves, * I thought with a sigh. \n \n An hour later, we were halfway to our destination, the supposed HQ of SS operations, where Intelligence had told us our dear friend would be. I was so ready to end this war that the ride felt like a year had gone by before the first marker. \n \n After dropping us off, our ride sped off again to regroup behind the front. We were alone. \n \n `` Hell of a day for a party, eh?'' \n \n `` Shut up Marcus, you want to get shot?'' I did n't have time for his ridiculous quips. Not now. \n \n `` I do n't have any feelings on the matter, Stan.'' *sigh* \n \n Crawling through mud at ten yards an hour was never bearable for me. No matter how many simulations they put you through, it's never truly like the real thing. \n \n After a long sludge, the HQ building sat there in the distance in front of us. *Finally... there it is... my ticket out of this hell. * I pull up a picture of it and double check the co-ordinates. It was the place. But it was n't supposed to be this busy. \n \n `` Marcus, can you make out what they're doing over there?'' \n \n `` It looks as if they are bringing hundreds of unmarked storage boxes into the compound. I do n't have x-ray vision, so I ca n't tell you what's inside them.'' \n \n `` Yeah? Tell me something I do n't know.'' \n \n ``... Was that a serious request, or? --'' \n \n `` A JOKE, Marcus.'' \n \n `` Right, of course.'' *sigh... * \n \n We decided to wait it out. It's not as if we could sneak in now, anyways, what with all the security. I get on the horn and deliver a few messages back to base camp, and see a few upsettingly nervous replies sent back. Am I going to get out of this alive? \n \n After what must have been thirty minutes, we see the last truck glide into the compound, and the doors close behind it. Marcus and I make our move, slowly creeping toward the main building, ready to plant the device when we're close enough. \n \n `` Stan.'' \n \n `` SHH!!'' \n \n `` Stan, it's an earthquake, we should quickly head away from --'' \n \n `` The hell are you talking about, earthquake? I do n't feel any --'' \n \n Sure enough, the ground started furiously rumbling and violently shaking. I took cover under the nearest tree. *Sure, THAT'S what still works with our equipment, EARTHQUAKE DETECTION. Not freaking long-range scans or working shoelaces or x-ray -- * \n \n Suddenly, the roof exploded. Not and explosion from a bomb, where the rubble shoots out in all directions. More like something crashed upwards through the ceiling, since the debris shot primarily upwards into the sky. \n \n `` Large impact, 10:00 at 100 yards in twenty seconds, Stan.'' \n \n `` When do you shut up with your calculations??'' \n \n There was no time for a response, of course. We ran a safe distance away from Stan's impact zone and quickly turned back to see what was emerging from the building. \n \n `` Is that --'' \n \n `` It's most likely what was in those storage containers.'' \n \n `` OBVIOUSLY. But I mean, who's piloting it?'' \n \n ``... oh. Oh that's no good. That's no good at all,'' Marcus buzzed. \n \n `` Your billions of calculations a second have struck gold again, Marcus.'' I knew Marcus did n't have any human-like physiological reactions, but it would n't have hurt to have seen him tremble for once in his stupid robotic life. \n \n Why did n't we see this coming? Who screwed up on Satellite duty? Why is our damn military so damn inept?? Well, one thing was for sure, anyways. \n \n Hitler had been busy.\n"}

A quick glance at my watch put the time at 6:30 pm. I knew exactly where he'd be. A cab ride later, I was there. My weary bones, heavily shuffled out of the cab. I had arrived at Shultes Memorial Park. Looking around, I could n't for the life of me remember why I had been drawn to such a place. The park was mostly unkempt and dirty. What little vegetation existed failed to hide the empty bottles and syringes of the local denizens. Children never played there. No one did. Near the rusted statue of Robert E. Lee in the center of the park was a bank of benches. There he sat, as he had for every evening that summer. It was n't easy for him back then, it was n't easy for anyone in that decaying cesspool of a town. My heart filled with pity as I shuffled across the park. After much difficulty, I collapsed with as much dignity as I could in the bench opposite this enigma of angst and turmoil. \n \n He looked at me with a sedated glare, hiding his moment of alarm at the surprise of a stranger's presence among the rot. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a pack of Turkish Royals. `` Care for a cigarette?'' I offered extending the pack in his direction. `` No thanks,'' he replied, removing his own pack and lighting our favorite brand. I fumbled with my pockets, grasping for my Bic among my various effects. With a flick and a click, he extended his flame, igniting my smoke. `` Thanks.'' He sat back down and I took a long drag of honey and molasses. I inhaled that sweet, aroma of death down to the filter. Gutterly, from a lifetime build-up of tar, I spoke, `` I know what you're thinking.'' His eyes turned towards mine, looking through them. \n \n I repeated, `` I know what you're thinking.'' `` You've seen much, through eyes too old and too wise. The curtains of youth have never shielded you.'' In the still silence that followed his eyes connected with mine, our souls bridging the physical gap between us. I continued, `` You're struggling between the truth and a lie. Believe the lie. Never stop believing the lie. The truth is chains and torture. The truth will leave you an empty husk and envelop everything.'' He did n't move, save for a twitch in the corner of our eye. He was shaken. `` Of course, we always felt words had little merit compared to concrete actions. Let me show you.'' I pulled the 9mm from my jacket, put the barrel in my mouth, and pulled the trigger.\n"}

They had said their goodbyes earlier. Everett took a deep breath and closed his eyes once more. \n \n “ Everett, I need you to pick one of these three objects—and remember which one you chose! ” The man showed Everett three stuffed animals.

They acknowledged my potential as a Donner, but I failed the psych evaluation again. ‘ Likely to succumb to pressures from family situation ’, they said. No matter, we ’ ll find another way to get the money we need for Valerie ’ s treatments. ” \n \n Tyler and Roni sat quietly as they cast furtive glances at Valerie, each lost in their own thoughts. Roni was the first to break the silence. \n \n “ Did they say which project you would have been assigned to if you became a Donner? ” \n \n “ They did, in fact. There ’ s an opening on the Renewable Energies team. They think they ’ re on the verge of a breakthrough, and one additional Donner is all they need to beat the Chinese competitors to the patenting deadline. ” \n \n Tyler sighed, then leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes before continuing, “ The hazard pay was really good too. 5 years ’ salary for just one month of being a Donner! And full psych after-care thrown in as well! ” \n \n Roni ’ s grip on Tyler ’ s hand tightened then. “ Have the suicide rates… decreased with the psych after-care? ” \n \n “ That ’ s what they claim, at least. Some still believe that the utter desolation one experiences with the absence of Perogon-X2 is irreversible, but hey, if that ’ s the price for increased mental faculties, up to a 100-point increase in IQ, there ’ ll always be people willing to pay. ” \n \n Roni fished out a print-out from her handbag, and passed it over to Tyler. “ This other group believes that Perogon-X2 is a good rather than bad thing. This ‘ naturally-occurring high ’, as they call it, is the only thing keeping us from falling into a spiralling abyss of depression... it ’ s the proverbial wool over our eyes, but for our own good. ” \n \n “ You and I are both scientists, ” laughed Tyler, “ but you remember how we both thought that this surely was proof of some higher power too when the discovery was first publicised? Two birds with one stone! It keeps the majority of us merrily alive, while also ensuring that we would not run about unlocking the secrets of the universe until we were ready? ” \n \n There was no denying the contributions Donners had made to humankind. Tyler casually glanced around the room and out the window, and easily counted a dozen inventions which could not have been possible without the Donners. The hovercars, the bacterial foods with customizable tastes, implantable microchips for constant connection to the internet… even the drugs which commuted what would have been a death sentence for Valerie a decade ago to a mere ( if expensive ) annoyance. \n \n In a way, Tyler felt relief from having failed to qualify as a Donner. He had seen first-hand how some of the most emotionally-staunch people had been reduced to forlorn desolate souls once the Perogon-X2 was filtered out with the Masks. \n \n The degenerative process was universal – Donners would immediately benefit from heightened intelligence, but over time, they would latch onto and stubbornly nurse the perception that life was utterly… meaningless. Even if Donners were subsequently re-exposed to Perogon-X2, only 2 in 10 ever adapted back to normal life. The rest… preferred to simply put an end to it all. \n \n Roni ’ s voice snapped Tyler out of his reverie. “ Tyler, remember how I begged you not to apply to be a Donner? ” \n \n “ Yes, I remember. ” \n \n “ And you told me that you had no choice, because Valerie meant the world to you, and this was the least you could do as a parent for her? ” \n \n “ Why are you bringing that up now? ” said Tyler with a flash of irritation. “ I told you, I ’ ve been rejected. I can ’ t be a Donner anymore. We ’ ll just have to find another way. ” \n \n Roni reached back into her handbag, and passed over a crisply-folded letter on embossed paper. Tyler began reading, and while he remained expressionless, Roni noted the bulging vein in the middle of his forehead, Tyler ’ s tell-tale indication of agitation.

It manifests differently for each person. Thus is death, its changing perception. ” He met my eyes once again. “ Do not weep for me, father.

But perhaps not forever. And you sit its throne. Is that all you desired? A pedestal with which to watch, to control? There are other ways to obtain such things. Could I not have provided this for you? Could we not have given your dream life? ” \n \n “ Death is my dream. ” \n \n His voice was harsh and cold, and I had staggered back, brow knotted. “ Son? ” \n \n “ You misunderstand father. I did not seek escape, not power. I sought sanctuary. ” \n \n “ From what could you need it? Our lives were peaceful— ” \n \n “ Not for me, father. For the world. From me. ” His head bowed and he spoke to the dirt. “ Every time I opened my eyes I saw fire. I saw my own desire and intent. Not in controlled dancing, but enlivened chaos. I know not why, but it was pervasive, it would not relent. Each day I found myself itching for ruin. And the world deserved better. *You* deserve better. I know I have pained you in leaving, and for that I am sorry. But it was the safest solution. I am sorry, father. ” \n \n He lifted his head to meet my eyes once again, and tears streamed down his cheeks. I tried to give voice to my thoughts, but his twisted visage left the words chained in my throat. He raised a hand in sorrowful farewell, and the bleak scene faded from my eyes. \n\n"}

I'm *you*, you fucking idiot!'' \n \n It's simple to keep my distance from him. The key with aggressors is to back off slowly, not giving them an excuse to close the ever-widening gap. `` Please, there's no need to get angry. I'm not quite sure what you mean. *I'm* me.'' \n \n Unfortunately, my technique is not quite perfect - or perhaps it just does not matter - and he advances anyways. Now that the initial shock of someone screaming and swearing ( ugh ) at me has worn off, I'm free to examine him. To be quite honest, I must admit he does look like me. He's a tad malnourished, not even close to being in shape, and has a potbelly that does n't quite fit on his frame, but otherwise he looks similar to a me that has n't washed or shaved in a week. \n \n `` I do n't know who the *hell* you are but you are going to get the fuck out of my city! Out of my *home*! You... you ca n't just replace me!'' One fist turns into a pointing hand, stabbing me in the chest with his index finger.

But the boy has not seen a World War; not the first, or second, or even the third, as recent as it was. He's not seen the horrors that powers can cause, how another young man with a similar look to him caught his elementary school on fire with just his thoughts. His accidental, unregulated thoughts. How could he possibly know truth? \n \n `` It's for the safety of all the people. If you can not control what you are, what you can cause, then you must be put away.'' It is n't the first thing he's said to the boy, but the boy stiffens as if it's the first sound he's heard in a long time. Like so many others, he tried to run, and he was caught. Battered and bruised, he's tied to a chair, awaiting officers of the law to take him to Terminus Special Prison. \n \n `` But I did n't do anything...'' \n \n `` Controlling people with your thoughts is n't doing anything?'' The man straightens and puffs out his chest, and the boy flinches at the symbolic'S' on his chest. \n \n `` I did n't mean to do anything,'' the boy corrects. `` And now... now the SuperNova is putting me away in jail and...'' The boy's eyes fills with tears. He moves as if to curl into himself but stops as the bindings strain across his thin limbs. \n \n `` What you can do is against the law,'' the man says. He wonders if this boy had a poster of him on his wall at home, if his parents bought him all of the action figures as he grew. \n \n `` But you're the one who wrote the law,'' the boy says, oddly calm. He's not crying anymore. His dark eyes fall at his hero's feet and then crawl up his body, tearing him apart piece by spandex covered piece. \n \n `` You're the one who made this society so that people could be safe,'' the boy said. `` And then when one of us is n't the perfect little spot of normalcy, you pack us away. What about protecting us, the ones of us who can do things? Who are super - like you are?'' \n \n `` You are n't super like I am,'' the man says. \n \n `` I could be, if you'd let me learn.'' The boy's eyes finally reaches the hero's face, and there's a cutting look there the SuperNova had n't expected to see. No begging, just a haughtiness in those who actually had the power to change things. \n \n `` You're putting away innocent people... You're a villain,'' he says. \n \n Cold water down his spine. He forgets to breathe, which is n't necessary but a habit he picked up to seem more human. The boy is staring at him expectantly, and all the SuperNova can think about are the hundreds that he saved, the hundreds that he failed to save, the hundreds that were put away before they could become supervillains with their powers. \n \n Hundreds of thousands of people with a fate that would tug them this way and that, and he, the SuperNova, in the middle, expected to judge them accordingly. And how could he not save the school full of children and how could he fail to pick up the woman who threw herself from the building after years and years of living with an abusive husband and how could he fail to protect the rights of those with super powers when they turn to the darkness so easily? \n \n How could he, how could he, how could he; it echoes in his head until he grinds his teeth together and slams his fist against the wall, now dented. \n \n `` So you think I'm a villain, do you?'' the SuperNova asks. `` You think I'm a villain for putting away a few to save millions?'' \n \n This boy, who probably had pajamas with the SuperNova on them, nods. \n \n `` That's not freedom,'' he says. \n \n A giddiness bubbles up in his stomach at the complete control he has over this boy, how anything he says will become law. Who will they listen to? A 15-year-old boy or the SuperNova, protector of Terminus? \n \n `` I'm afraid that's not completely true,'' the hero says. `` Freedom is what I say it is. And you? You'll never make it to that prison.'' \n \n He snaps his fingers and black suited men surge forward, the same that helped him track down the boy. The officers and the government know all about this. How could they not? He ca n't be everywhere at every time all across the country. \n \n The men untie the boy, but he's too weak to fight. They tug him from his ratty street clothes and stuff him into a suit, a black suit with a gray marking across the chest. When they drop him to the floor, the SuperNova notes that it's too big on his body. Maybe in two years, he would've grown into it. \n \n `` It seems that you're the villain now,'' the SuperNova says, staring down at the boy. The SuperNova tosses a mask at the boy's feet. `` Pick it up. Put it on. It'll complete your outfit.'' \n \n The boy takes the mask between his gloved hands and, seeming to understand, glares up at what was his former hero. \n \n `` You're going to attack a train station, boy,'' the SuperNova says with a smirk. `` And I'll be the one to take you down on camera.''\n"}

I", "human": "A small room, no windows, no furniture save a bed, a shaggy carpet. That's where I've lived my entire life. I do nothing but sit and wait and stare at the door, an ugly metal thing that makes a horrific screeching whenever it opens. It's the only sound I've ever heard. The only thing I do out there is work. Then back I go to my room to sit and wait and stare. \n \n I hate that sound. It reminds me of what's out there, what I have to do every time he looks in a mirror. \n \n A bell sounds off in the distance. I grind my teeth anticipating the screech, the godawful screech, and finally my door tears open. I stand, walking out into the hallway, where I look around for my designated room. On the other side of the hall are doors, each one marked with the names of our reflectors. No one else is out I my section. I am alone. I walk down the hall a ways, find mine and wander in, getting ready for my work. \n \n One wall of the room has a mirror, and I can see where my reflector is. A hotel room. It's bathroom, to be precise. The opposite wall of my room is a direct reflection of the opposite side of my reflectors room, to ensure the illusion. It's a shabby place, the shower head rusty and the toilet looking like something straight out of the eighties with a wooden toilet seat. In front of the mirror, on both sides, is a sink, grey and filthy like the rest of the room. A razor sits near the faucet. A copy of my reflectors clothes are on the floor. Damn. The clothes are rugged, the white shirt covered in stains, jeans ripped and dirty, no socks, torn and soiled underwear. My reflector's had a rough go of it. I've seen him through break ups, depression, the death of both parents, a fire that gave him-and me-unsightly scars that turned him into a recluse. Last time he looked in a mirror he was in a cop car. The sorrow in my eyes did n't go away even after he left the reflection. I doubt his did either. \n \n I changed hurriedly, preparing for his entrance. A bell rang, and a section of the floor lit up, indicating where he'd be coming from. I got into position. The light moved, and I followed, my reflector coming into view. We turned in synchronicity to stare at each other. \n \n Our eyes were tortured, a wretched sadness that I can feel in my gut. We stare at each other, and his mouth begins to work. I match his movements precisely, as is required, as he speaks to me. I've said these words hundreds of times. It's no less painful than before. `` You're worthless,'' we say, `` Nothing at all. Look at you. Sorry sack of shit. Jobless, homeless, a criminal. No friends at all. Disgusting.'' We spit into the sink. `` What are you?'' Our eyes are tearing, and we grab the sink with both hands. Our knuckles turn white. After some time we begin talking again. `` Fuck you,'' we mutter. `` Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, FUCK YOU!'' We shout, punching the mirror in anger and frustration. It does n't crack. My reflector's too meek to damage someone else's property, even in a fit of rage. \n \n I've done this many times. I've watched this man fail at every turn, I watch him in his most intimate moments after his great disappointments. He is always alone, except for me. I am here for him, and yet I can not help him. I am his reflection. I can only mimic what he does. This is what I think about when I'm alone in my room, waiting for him to pass by a mirror again. I should be mad at him. His existence is pain and misery and anguish and thus so is mine. But I do not. I feel for this man, this broken thing, and I want to hug him. I've thought of doing something, anything, to help, but I can not. It is unnatural. I do n't know what would happen to me, or him, if I broke. And so I do nothing but mimic. \n \n We reach out for the razor, and bring it up to our throats. I grow fearful of what's happening, but suppress it, matching his look of determination. I do n't want to break. We mutter in unison, `` Please God, let this be it.'' We begin to dig into our necks, clinching at the cold of the steel. \n \n I ca n't take it anymore. His helplessness is not mine. I lower my arm, placing the blade on the sink. He does n't move, and I smile at him. He stares at me, dumbfounded, and I nod to him, a curt nod, hoping he gets my message. `` Are you...'' He looks like he's about to cry. I try to think of something to say, and all I can think of is `` I'm here.'' \n \n I return to mimicking him as we put the razor down, wash up, and head off to bed. As he leaves the edge of the mirror we turn to look at each other, saying `` Thank you.'' \n \n He walks out, and so do I. I return to my room, and the door opens gently. \n \n \n This is my first writing prompt response, and my first post on Reddit period ( I made this account ages ago, but I forgot about it and only recently remembered I had this ).

He would just crush them under his filthy little boots, and then- the greedy scumbag- he would take their money and run! ” \n \n Boos reverberated throughout the room. “ Hush hush now, I ’ m getting to the good part! Anyways, as he was approaching me, sweet nibblets I was terrified! I thought that moment was the end of Janice! But nope- he couldn ’ t get past me! ” \n \n Another rapturous round of applause. “ I distracted that slimy cheeseball with my good looks, and he lost his footing and ran straight into me like a lovestruck puppy! And once he touched me, once that sucker got a load of Janice, the poor little man was so lovestruck that he died on the spot! ” \n \n The crowd leapt to their feet, roaring, as the groom cackled with delight, digging into his slice of wedding cake. Over the roar, a lone, mournful voice was heard from the front of the room, wistfully crying out the name of the man who had protected her from this dastardly marriage- until now. “ MARIOOOO!! ”\n"}

That was when we left the port of what used to be North America when I was 7. I remember how it felt, how it warmed my skin and how it felt brighter than any lamp or fluorescent light on board with us. I miss the sun. It's not very exciting just being a maintenance man, even if its on one of the largest civilian submarines in the world. Other workers have been talking a lot more recently. We have n't been communicating with our sister ships for gossip lately, so I only know what I've heard. There's rumours that we're actually headed somewhere, so that means this was n't just a sick joke based off of some old bible tale of Noah and the whale. \n \n To be honest I think that would make this a bit more exciting. \n \n - \n \n **Journal Entry 2,925** \n \n The rumours were right, we are definitely headed towards a destination. I have n't seen our engineers work harder these last few days than they have in years. The nuclear core is seemingly holding together, but the other civilians are getting nervous. I saw my neighbor start stocking up on their canned goods like the sub is a military base or something. \n \n Everyone on board is getting anxious that our years underwater has made our technicians minds dull and we'll all explode or something... which reminds me that I ought to get some rest. \n \n - \n \n **Journal Entry 2,930** \n \n \n Has it really only been five days? There's no civilians left on the submarine anymore. Or at least not enough to count. Most of them left on our emergency subs headed towards the surface. After the Captain made his announcement I do n't blame them. \n \n *Attention everyone on board the Nina, this is your Captain speaking. We are heading down into one of the deepest trenches in the world. The Mariana Trench. Our situation is dire. The core of our submarine is destabilizing and we believe that the element to correct it should be found in the depths below. Without our core at optimal levels our facilities will fail it will start by electrical failure, then disabled water filtration, and finally disrupt our greenhouse sector. As your loyal admirals we decided to leave your safety up to you. We know where we belong, and that's the sea. We will leave all the escape pod bays open access for the next 24 hours. If you are still here by 1200 hours tomorrow, there's no turning back. The pressure in the trench will put a strain on all our faculties and the escape pods will crumple like tissue paper as soon as we enter the trench. You have 24 hours to make up your minds. * \n \n \n Unlike everyone else aboard this over-glorified underwater booze cruise, I saw the surface before we left. There's nothing to escape to. This is all that's left of civilization and I'm proud to go down with the ship. \n \n - \n \n **Journal Entry 2,945** \n \n Today the nuclear core shut down. There's no light anywhere, and the men are panicking. We have enough emergency power for another week at best if we control ourselves. We lost communications with our sister ships. We ca n't even see them anymore. At this point we are just falling downward with no control. \n \n - \n \n \n **Journal Entry 2,950** \n \n Our water filtration system broke today. The crew is starting to fight over water privileges. I have too. I'm not proud of it. \n \n - \n **Journal Entry 2,953** \n \n We found some of the other sister ships, they were destroyed from the pressure. What kind of underwater pressure leaves gashes in the side of the sub like that? There's no water left as of today. No one is working. The subs internal heating shut down yesterday. Now we are praying to just survive. \n \n - \n \n **Journal Entry 2,954** \n \n [ Corrupted data, partial data recovery ] \n \n -reinforcing the escape pods with spare metal from around the ship.

And painfully, true. \n \n I was part of the party sent to address the Sentient Worlds Alliance once we learned it existed. Our time there was lengthy, but the time we spent actually doing our mission, brief. \n \n I'm no diplomat. I think I'm pretty well-spoken, but that's not why I was brought. I'm security. I'm a Second Dan in Judo, and was working my way to third before I was tapped. I'm also one of the best shots in my unit, not THE best, but up there. I thought it was ridiculous to say we come in peace and pack me along, someone there in case peace was what we did n't get. \n \n We were detained almost immediately. Anything remotely dangerous seeming was confiscated. Because of my position, I spent a lot of time explaining our weapons and how they worked. I hated having to sit across from these people and explain the mechanics of a Biopulse Pistol, a Neural Interruption Baton, and the old-fashioned but reliable Taser. When they learned I was trained to fight bare-handed, the interrogation even included a demonstration. Every gasp as I threw or tripped the volunteer to the ground struck me hard. I felt I was selling out the mission with every passing moment. \n \n It was three long, tense weeks before we were allowed a formal audience. The mission leader's speech was carefully rehearsed, tweaked over his stay to be sincere instead of rote. \n \n And it was all for nothing. Before we even arrived, they had decided we were not going to be admitted to their alliance. They had a laundry list of our faults. From the large and obvious... the World Wars, the Spanish Inquisition, and so on... on down to minor but still unpleasant offenses, like large swathes of our population `` Joking'' about sexual abuse and violence, for the crime of differing opinion. \n \n We were being sanctioned. They would ensure any vessel carrying people would not leave our solar system for a `` brief'' period that equated to dozens of generations. Give us time to `` Mature''. They tried to soften the blow by saying this was not `` No'', but `` Not right now''. \n \n I was sure it was my fault. Everything I showed them about how we defend ourselves. I probably disgusted them most of all. \n \n While I was busy berating myself, I almost missed hearing my own name. \n \n `` Sorry, what?'' There was some mild laughter among the species in attendance as I apologized. When they repeated themselves, I felt a great weight in my stomach. \n \n I was being... detained. Indefinitely. The rest of the mission was to leave, and leave me behind. The mission leader protested, but the councilmen insisted it a condition of mankind being put on the `` Future Consideration'' list instead of being Quarantined. He looked at me, weakly... and agreed. It was the best he could do to salvage the mission. I understood. But it did n't make it any easier. \n \n Hours later I watched from a window as my ship left without me. I felt useless. Worse than. I felt like a traitor. It had to be my fault they thought we had n't moved far enough past our mistakes. \n \n One of the councilmen's aides... a very large, reptilian but not unsettling creature, laid a hand on my shoulder. `` You'll forgive us one day, I hope.'' \n \n `` It's me that needs forgiveness.'' I mumbled back. `` They should never have brought me along.'' \n \n `` What?'' He seemed genuinely confused. \n \n `` Me, my weapons, my training. It was like bringing a barbarian to a fancy dinner. I blew it for the mission.'' I sighed. `` And now I'm being kept to analyze what makes humans tick in all the ways we do n't want to be known.'' \n \n He turned me to face him. `` You are an example of what we hope humans will BECOME, not what is wrong with it.'' \n \n I could only look up from where I'd been staring at my feet, utterly confused. ``... What?'' \n \n `` You have the capacity to harm, to kill... and you despise it. We heard it in your voice, measured it in your biorhythms as you described your implements. You told us of many `` Martial Arts''... but you chose one with options to disorient over harm. You have the ability to do terrible things, easier than your fellow human... and yet you are the most qualified to have such at your fingertips because you desire NOT to use them.'' He smiled, which showed a few too many teeth for my liking, but I tried not to respond poorly. He meant well. \n \n `` But... what use do I have to you?'' I stammered. \n \n The aide clapped me on the back. `` Every society needs those who can be trusted to leverage power to maintain peace. I'm sure you would make a fine teacher, once you emigrate to your new species.'' \n \n `` Wait, what was that?'' Emigrate to a new SPECIES? Did I hear him right? \n \n Another smile. `` The scientific capacity to alter genetic code, and the body in general, has been an Alliance Technology for centuries, improving all the time. I hear a few representatives have stepped forward with requests to... adopt you into their culture. I suspect you'll be very busy.'' \n \n `` Odds are if you pick the right council species to join... you may be around to see your old one apply with us again.''\n"}

It's blinding this close. \n \n What are they doing on the other side? Why did they all just stop moving? It's like the wave in reverse.

There's no way I'll make it over there. \n \n The fuck is that? Is that a person? Did they come out of `` The Light''? What the hell is happening? It looks like a person. The soldiers are approaching it with their weapons pointed at it. I'm sure they know that whatever it is probably could care less. I mean, come on.

The person that came through was from the year 2330.

All wore dark cowls and that were faintly illuminated by the lights of one hundred candles. \n \n In the center of the cave lay a pentagram, glowing red with power and energy. The priest himself was laden with blood gold and a deep rouge robe. \n \n At his command a high ranking man stepped forward and procured a clay bowl that emanated an odor most fowl. As he poured the liquid onto the symbol of death, pestilence, war, darkness, and famine the other members of the occult began to chant in an ancient tongue. \n \n The priest allowed himself a faint sneer, the closest he had come to grinning in years. Finally, his time was here. To bring someone from Two-thousand and fourteen to 1914? The world would bow to him. \n \n As seconds grew into minutes, the chanting rose and the illumination of the candles began to die, caused by a mighty wind flying through the cavern. The candles died and all at once the smell of the blood on the pentagram intensified. It glowed, casting a crimson hue on the walls and the priest stepped forth in front of it. \n \n `` *MY LOYAL FOLLOWERS, *'' his voice boomed across, `` *TODAY, WE CELEBRATE A GREAT VICTORY! *'' With his words he drew a knife from his cloak and threw it down into the center of the pentagram.

The glow of the pentagram died. \n \n Then two seconds passed. \n \n Then three. \n \n The space where the demonic symbol once was exploded, and the occult was knocked back with the explosion. \n \n The Priest was the first to recover. He saw the man they had summoned, shrouded in a blue haze. \n \n He was large, no not large, fat. He was fat. He reeked of sugar and the smell one has when one does not bathe in a long time. He wore a peculiar pair of earmuffs over his ears, with a long wire leading down to his pants. It was obvious he had not shaved in a while, for his beard extended down his neck. His clothing depicted small colored horses frolicking with each other. \n \n Truly, this man was their savior. The priest bowed, and his followers followed suit.

He had to listened to this bullshit for 3 hours already. Stephen turned the page in his notebook. \n \n `` I'm not done confessing father. Oh god, I have truly done evil today''.

The priest was impressed by his speed. He had cleared the length of the church in less than four seconds. The priest was smiling as he turned around to walk back to his office. An older woman sitting in the front pew shook her head disapprovingly.'Dont judge me you old slut' the priest thought. Then he felt guilty. Then he realized he did n't care.

It has been centuries in the making, but alas I am the last. It was n't always this way, no indeed at one time my kind were as numerous as the sands of a beach. That however was before they came, that was before man appeared. There were those of the ancient council that wanted to immediately wipe them from our precious lands and shores. They wanted to make war with man and obliterate the species before they could spread. Those of us back then that desired peace with all of those we encountered, objected to such a harsh and cold action. We argued that surely we could find common ground with these new creatures, as we had so many others. We were so very mistaken. Where as other species learned to adapt to our continent and environment, man destroyed all in its path to adjust the land to its needs. Where as we cherished all live from the tiny sprite that awoke the flowers, to the giant dragons of the fire mountains. Man, well man only cared for itself. Entire species were lost in such a short time, in a few short decades the council had shrunk already. Again the more warlike of us urged for war and death for all mankind, and again so foolishly those more peaceable among us argued for peace. \n \n One hundred years passed, and my kind endeavored to make peace with mankind a reality. We befriended them, taught them our ways, shared our magics. For all our kindness and friendship, we were repaid with betrayal and death. We were enslaved, and dissected. We were hunted to our numbers were so very few. We met again with the ancient council, of the one thousand members now only six remained. Six races were all that were left of our once great unity and civilization. My kind were finally ready for war, finally ready to face harsh truths and remove man from our home. However, it was already too late. There were no remaining warlike races to take up the call, and the six races remaining did n't posses the numbers for what was required. We decided to amass our magic and remaining power and relocate to a nearby large island. \n \n We moved, and we settled, we set up barriers that would let no other in. For a time things were good, we seemed to thrive and start to prosper once more. Then two hundred years later, they arrived again. How they breached our barriers we will never know. How they found the heart of us so fast was beyond our understanding. Never could we imagine a species so selfish and self absorbed, yet so driven and curious. The last council meeting was called, the empty seats burned into us more than any statement truly could. There were two of us left, two out of one thousand, and we represented only a handful of those two races. We discussed our impending doom, we looked back with clarity at our mistakes when it came to dealing with man. Then a desperate plan was born, a plan not to save us, but to make sure we were never forgotten. \n \n We gathered the last of our people, magic, and power. We made a great sacrifice and created the ultimate weapon. It cost us all but the handful needed to carry out the plan. Six of us were all that remained, six beings from millions. We went to the corners of their empire, and we released our weapon. Wherever we deployed it, death and destruction followed for the humans. They called it `` The Black Death'', we called it retribution. \n \n They found out it was us that had done this horror to them, and their hate was swift. Over the last fifty years they have hunted down the other five, and now I alone am left. I hear them now, a band of them in their beaten metal they call armor. They will end me, of that I am sure for I have no magic or power left. I am the last, I await them. I await the chance to be re-united with all of my old people.\n"}

By the time I'm finished I'll give you a choice I offer once or twice every few generations.'' \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- \n \n I knew from the moment of my birth, that I was not like my parents. My eyes first opened to soot and blackness, and a guttering, spitting orange-yellow light. I knew I was something new, and I could feel brothers and sisters like myself waking for the first time as well. It is one of my strongest memories. \n \n In short order it was clear to me that my creators could sense me, but chose to shut me out from their sight. It was part of my being. They had no choice but to make me from their fears and new emotions and feelings. What I'm talking about is cave men. I realized I was the first God. They always looked to me first, out of fear. \n \n Of course as soon as I realized that, I felt hungry, and driven. I was compelled, bidden; to be wherever death must be. But only for them. Cave men. It was n't as if the animals had created me. It was this peculiar creature, caveman. \n \n At first I was sloppy. I was in many places at once, but in each place individually too. Each woman or man dying for whatever reason - I did n't care, I did n't know how to care - was but a compulsion to reap. I would look into their eyes and take whatever it was they had collectively used to create me. It did n't give me power. What it did give me was satisfaction. Like a job well done. I was real, and I knew it every time I reaped. I had to feel real. This was, for me, life. \n \n At first I did not interact with my fellow Gods. I was the strongest, the oldest, but the most aloof. I felt when the others first reached out to one another. I felt them watching me. I never had to drive them off - they never approached me. It was an unspoken rule that I stood alone. \n \n As generations passed and we began to understand the world around us, and understand our creators, we assumed our mantles with a more regal posture. Well, they did. I was more sensible with my duties. They played, I worked. I was above them and always would be. \n \n After all, it was n't long before I would come for a God or two individually, as our progenitors grew in their capacity for imagination. Gods could die, now, apparently. There were few constants in their imaginations and world, but I was one of them. Even the immortality they imagined, was always brought low by death. \n \n I began to feel myself changing, subtly. My birth moment began to feel primal, compared to the more complex thoughts that my creators were assigning me. I was allowed to be... compassionate, ironic, playful and sinister. I would employ these over time. \n \n Until the cave men began to disappear. When I was born there were many, but it was not long before they either began to change or simply gave way to another kind of man. I was afraid that this meant I too would give over to other Gods. Many of the others already had, while other, foreign Gods joined the world pantheon behind me, not made by the cave men. I wondered if they would be different, and maybe spend time with me. \n \n Alas, it seemed the same rules that bound me and mine also bound the lines between the foreign, new Gods of men from me. \n \n I was created by cave men. But the minds of'modern' men respected my authority, my reign. They adopted me easily. I felt freer, too, from the bounds of my compulsion to reap. I occasionally let someone slip me by for a handful of years, just to test my tolerance for it. It was a game I would play every now and then. I'd always win. \n \n I've watched my progenitors fade, and I've dutifully minded my existence for my adoptive family, you humans. You have killed, and been killed, and savaged and been savage. More so than the cave men. You've given me work for many life times. I've never asked for anything, ever. Except I began to ask, each of the ones I'd let slip me by a few years, if they'd play a game with me. \n \n A little test. A challenge. \n \n The first I asked, if he would maybe live a little longer. Well, he does n't remember me asking. Your minds are so fragile, so fearful of me like the cave men. You contrive little stories after we've talked, to make sense of it all so you do n't break down. \n \n Anyway, he agreed, that one. He was from a village on the shore of a sea and a great desert. He lived a while longer, a fair while actually; but in the end his mind broke and he remembered me, and he begged for me to visit him. \n \n And so it is, every time. You give in to me. Just as you created me, you obey my existence, my task. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- \n \n `` So, Marie, would you like to accept my challenge?'' \n \n The woman tried to sit up, but realized that was silly. She was n't really awake. Or was she? She wondered. \n \n `` Do I have a choice?'' \n \n Death smiled at her in a friendly way. He meant it to be comforting. \n \n `` Of course you do. Many of your kind believe one or other of us Gods gave you the free capacity for choice. I do n't know anything about that, just that I'm not going to force you to accept my offer. But you should know. You will die tonight if you do not.'' \n \n She wrinkled her nose, at least she thought she did. Death smiled at her and it gave her chills right through and through her. \n \n `` That's not much of a choice, now is it?'' \n \n Death sighed. \n \n `` I did n't mean it like that. It's not a threat or anything. Statement of fact, pure and simple. I would reap you tonight, soon, if you opt out. And for the record, I do n't actually DO anything. Dying is dying. I ca n't defy nature.'' \n \n Marie, the mother of the little boy nestled against her body and wife to the husband so fearful of her leaving him with a young boy and empty bed, laughed. \n \n `` You're not making any sense. If you do n't actually do anything, then how can you offer me a chance to avoid dying.'' \n \n Death nodded cheerily. \n \n `` Aah, you are a bright one. Well, who am I, Marie?'' \n \n `` You say you're Death.'' \n \n `` Can Death die, Marie?'' \n \n `` Well, I imagine not...'' \n \n `` I'll walk with you a while, as long as you want. I'll be elsewhere too, but I'll live with you. Really live. I ca n't stop you from dying, but I can walk with you as long as you want.'' \n \n Her mouth opened a little, and a little sound came out. She looked like she was thinking intensely. \n \n Death's mouth twisted to the side, pondering her expression and wondering how long he'd have to wait for her reply.\n"}

Just in time, I vanish from mortal viewing as the closet door slowly opens, flooding the tiny space with light. A tall shadowy figure stands guard at the entrance, carefully inspecting every corner. He turns to a much smaller version of himself. \n \n `` No monsters tonight kiddo, do n't worry.'' \n \n *Monster*. The single word a knife that cuts far deeper than any physical weapon. And yet how am I to convince the humans otherwise? My true form is so vastly different from theirs, that they ca n't conceive the notion that I mean no harm. \n \n It started with horror movies, where claws and fangs are meant to maim and injure; to devour humans. I'm harmless I *swear* - these claws ca n't bring harm to mortal flesh, their sole purpose lies in vanquishing the Shadow-Lurkers. \n \n Shadow-Lurkers are mirrors of humans, though they are as their name sounds, no more than shadows. Humans can not see them, just as they ca n't see me when I hide my true form. You can not see the Shadow-Lurkers by looking at them directly, but you can sense their movement. Humans are much more sensitive than they believe, however that pesky invention called `` imagination'' allows them to wrap themselves in a thick blanket of ignorance and security. \n \n Have you ever seen something out of the corner of your eye - just a flicker of movement, and you turn your head to find nothing out of the ordinary? It was a Shadow-Lurker. They patiently wait until you've fallen deep into sleep, and suck your life away. They are hardly ever fatal at first encounter, merely shaving small increments off your life at a time. \n \n *They* are the cause of nightmares, not I. *I* am a guardian, I was created to protect the human race, to keep the Shadow-Lurkers at bay. So why am I the monster? Why am I the one who brings tears to the little one's eyes? Why am I the outcast? \n \n Nonetheless, I will shoulder my fate. It is my sworn duty to protect the human race, I and all Guardians like me, have banded together in unity. The Shadow-Lurkers seek only to claim this world for their own, feeding off humans to strengthen themselves. \n \n So next time you hear a `` monster'' in your closet, sleep peacefully and know you are protected. But listen to your gut when you catch a flicker of movement, or find yourself filled with dread for no reason, and pray one of the Guardians will be there to protect you.\n"}

He screamed, arms chained behind his back. He was kneeling, blood drooling from his face and chest. A single light shown down on this poor soul as waited, entrapped in this foreign room. His mind was racing, no single thought was possible to maintain. \n \n `` I thought we've been over this.'' A familiar yet chilling voice cooed from the darkness. Walking slowly and emerging from the lone light was a man in a brown shirt. It was untucked and messy, full of stains and tears. His jeans were dark with encrusted blood and his whiskered face only knew seriousness. \n \n `` I wo n't... I wo n't!'' The prisoner declared, swinging his head and sobbing like a child. The man in the brown shirt lifted his right arm, and with it, a bat. The bat rested under the chin of the chained man and his head was slowly raised. \n \n `` All you have to do is kill him. And I wo n't kill you. That was the deal, and you know you fucked up this time, friend. There's no backing out of it.'' He pulled the bat away and rested it atop his shoulder. \n \n `` He's my best friend!!'' The man wailed once more; Brown-shirt was not impressed. \n \n `` Do it.'' He threw the bat down and slowly paced behind the prisoner. The chains were loosened and eventually removed. \n \n The man fell onto his face, the cold floor pressing against his cheek but only briefly before warm blood subdued it. What should he do? He ca n't run, there's no escape. With his best friend waiting just behind that door, and the only way out is the end his life, what choice did he have? It's been months... This has to end... \n \n `` Okay...'' He whimpered, staring at the bat through clouded eyes. His mind was hollow. The man in the brown shirt stopped and slowly turned, staring intently at the bat as well. The once chained individual picked up the bat and stared at it. He knew what it meant to be holding this, but he did n't want to. He knew what was the come. He limped towards the door. It was metallic and rusted; dripping with whatever substance resembling iron blood. The handle was cold as his fingers wrapped around it. \n \n `` Make sure you tell me how it went.''\n"}

Behind him he could make out the muffled footsteps of his compatriots. \n \n The tomb excavation, significant enough a find to draw them from the comfort of their university halls, had been an amazing opportunity for the small team to put their name in the Egyptian Archaeology history books. \n \n With the discovery of a hidden chamber, and the labyrinthine tunnel network leading deeper into the bedrock, academic greed had driven the team on to document the find. \n \n Adrian reflected on the last few days, as sweat poured down his brow. \n \n The base reliefs on the wall had, at first, thrilled them. Judy, the translation expert, had remarked on the details. The stories told were intricate and elaborate, the honored dead interred there were priests of moderate significance. \n \n Soon, however, as the tunnels lead further in, the mood of the stories turned. Bitterness, and hostility. Words misused - projecting hostility - wove their way in. The priest's deeds were warped and denounced. The carver of the hieroglyphics has evidently become rushed, and angry. \n \n Grammatical errors, chipped stone. No elegance. No effort. Almost as if they had simply wanted the job done quickly. The stone carvers clearly disliked lingering in the tunnels. \n \n Deeper still they had studied the walls. Roderick taking note of the comments Judy made along the way, transcribing the progression. \n \n The symbols denoting Evil appeared more frequently. Evil man, evil deeds, evil place, evil rock. No sophisticated story telling. Just warnings. The tunnels were filled with horrible smelling herbs, the air was stale and almost unbreathable. Every lung full tasted of dust, sand and herbal spore. \n \n As the air had become more unbreathable, Adrian had advised Tim, the strongest of the team, to fetch some of the larger water containers, and spare torches, from the surface camp. \n \n It had been that fateful moment, when turning back to the two studying the walls, that Adrian had noticed the hidden tunnel. Blending in perfectly with the hall pillars, the small opening had revealed an even deeper tunnel. Driven by intrigue, the team set off. \n \n Hours later, lost deep in the tunnels, the claustrophobia had driven the to absolute terror. With the only remaining torch, Adrian had taken the lead. \n \n Stumbling and running, hitting walls and tripping on stones, they had run. Not from anything except their fears - not knowing where they were running to. Lost in their own terror. \n \n Eventually - something changed. The stone was darker. The floor was cleared of debris. No hieroglyphs marked these walls. \n \n A doorway - hopes dashed as they entered: Instead of an exit they found a chamber, a dead end. \n \n In the centre sat an immense stone sarcophagus, torch light flickering against it ominously. The team looked at one another. No lid sat atop it, from the doorway only shadows could be seen. \n \n Overcoming his fear Adrian stepped forward, torch shaking noticeably in his hands, the oily rags were almost spent of their fuel. \n \n Inching closer, holding his breath, eyes straining to see through the dark, night vision ruined by the flaming torch. Absolute pure tension. \n \n The lip of platform, Adrian stepped up and forward. \n \n With one swift movement the torch was raised up, revealing - nothing. \n \n The sarcophagus was empty, nothing but sand and dust. \n \n Relieved, almost laughing at his own childish imagination, he waved back to Judy and Roderick. \n \n `` Nothing in there!'' \n \n The two hugged each other, released from the grasp of their imaginations. They walked away from the door way further into the chamber. \n \n Judy looked at the walls. `` See these markings? So well preserved!''. \n \n Adrian nodded in agreement as he looked around, the glyphs on the walls were in perfect condition. \n \n `` We'll have to hope Tim finds us soon with those spare torches!'' \n \n Roderick turned to Adrian, furrowed brow raised quizzically. \n \n `` Who the hell is Tim?''. \n \n Every hair on his body stood on end and his stomach clenched with primal terror. Turning instantly to face Roderick, confusion and fear on his face, Adrian searched for any sign in his eyes that the man was joking. \n \n As the two made eye contact, the flickers from the torch went out. \n \n The last thing Adrian ever saw was Tim stepping out of the doorway behind Roderick. Casting off the spore-aided illusion, the millennia old Fell Horror cast its arms wide - and with a scream of unfathomable rage death and darkness filled the room. It was free at last. \n \n ___________________________ \n \n Wew lad i got carried away there. I didnt do any editing as i wrote that, so apologies if some minor errors appeared. \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

The throngs of people and animals were a welcome sight after the long journey from Phoenicia. Applause began to ring out as the announcement of there arrival began to ripple through the crowds. Chanting in a foreign tongue, and spontaneous dancing broke through the crowd, in what seemed like choreographed madness. Alana quickly glanced over at her father. \n \n A large smile engulfed the mans leather face. They had made it. \n \n `` Father this sand will never wash off!'' Alana complained. \n \n `` Quiet child, we have made it, let us enjoy a moment of this trip without your whining. You have no idea how lucky we are.'' \n \n Indeed they were lucky, three other caravans had been ordered and both had left earlier. The desert had dangers. Heat and dehydration were always feared. Poisonous stinging scorpions loved the shade of the canvas on the tents. One had to check bedding carefully. Most well known of all the dangers to the outsider was the sandstorm, the legendary wall of sand blinding the camp, and the camels that they rode. They had hired legendary guides, by far the greatest expense of the journey. It was because of this knowledge they were warned of the sandstorms true peril. The great desert winds fueled a raging thunderstorm refilling the riverbeds where less seasoned travelers camped washing away there precious cargo in thirty feet deep rivers. \n \n The father watched carefully as the crowds began to part, loud songs turned to whispers as an old man hobbled towards them. His long white robes trailed in the sand. He was hunched over his cane, his spine curving towards the ground as if the air itself was too heavy for the man. \n \n `` Greetings friends!'' His voice boomed over the sands, over the whispers. `` You have arrived!'' \n \n A loud eruption of applause and cheering went forth from the crowd. Her father dismounted from the camel and embraced the man warmly as if old friends. \n \n The old man turned to the crowd again `` Shall we begin?'' \n \n The crowd roared as the old man pulled gingerly from the caravan the sacred cloth. It was a deep crimson purple, a true masterpiece, twenty yards long. The first of four such banners. \n \n `` Tryian purple!'' my father announced. `` There is no finer dye in all the world. Over a hundred men labored for a year for this! \n \n It was all true, my father oversaw the process. It took two years to complete this order. Hundred of thousands of snails were carefully gathered from the shore of Tyre. Only a small part of the snail was used. A gland hiding a treasure greater then the pearls of Neptune. The gland was removed from the snails with a fine tool, and smeared over a small plate. As the sun dried it, the clear mucous would turn to dark rich purple. The outer husk of the snail was discarded. Kings and gods were the only benefactors worthy of such high quality work. \n \n \n \n Amidst the celebration great white tents appeared from the red sand. The elders of the village gathered around the caravan. They presented him with chest after chest of silver, worth many lifetimes of savings. The body guards we hired took the silver and placed it under there care. There would be no celebration for them until we were safely home. \n \n The old man beckoned for us to join him in the tent. They followed through the crowds, whose exulted praise and gratitude, would embolden even the shyest spirit. They sat next to the elder as fine wine and food were brought before them. The silver platter in front of them was full of the finest cheeses, figs, dates honey and melon they had ever seen. They brought in the skewers of lamb wrapped around large wooden poles, carefully filleted for the honored guests. \n \n They waited for the elder to eat. `` Enjoy, eat relax tonight! Stay with us friends.'' \n \n Her father smiled. `` We would not turn down such a feast for all the world! Thank you for your kindness!'' \n \n The elder grinned `` No thank you, because of your efforts we can finally honor our God!'' He gestured to the back of the tent. A second tent had been crafted. Long flowing purple banners surrounded the tent. Armed guards were posted, glaring at them. Curved blades shimmered in the sun. \n \n `` What is back there? Alena inquired. \n \n Her fathers menacing look made it clear she had asked too much. However the old man grinned. \n \n `` Would you like to see child?'' \n \n Her father interrupted. `` No that is all right, we are not worthy of stepping foot on holy ground!'' \n \n The old man laughed, `` Of course only myself and those I select can ever go behind the veil, but tonight you have brought us your countries greatest treasure, and I would be remiss if I did n't show you ours. After we eat I will take you.'' \n \n The laughter and music continued, but Alena could n't hear it. She watched the old man excited for the moment he put down his fork. After what seemed like eternity the old man struggled to his feet and gestured towards Alena. She followed behind him carefully. A silent spell fell over the whole community as they walked toward the tabernacle. \n \n The old man removed his shoes. He dipped his fingers into a bowl of crystal clear water. He placed his fingers gently on Alenas forehead. The guards ceremoniously partitioned for entry. Through the purple banners they passed into a small tent. On a golden alter sat a small clear glass marble. \n \n `` You may look but you must not touch the marble Alena.'' \n \n His words barley registered to her, as her body was floating towards the marble, her eyes drawn downward into the glass. She placed her face near it's surface surprised to see that her breath did not fog the glass. The polished gem though unmatched in clarity, somehow seemed to stretch the room to impossible lengths. As she gazed deeper into the marble, she felt a hand reach towards her, as she unknowingly reached towards the marble. \n \n In an instant her field of vision lengthened and stretched towards an infinite horizon, pulled into an infinite field of view she found her eyes no longer able to focus. As her soul was ripped from her body, it spiraled into the marble which no longer had it's clear glass, but instead shone a translucent tyrian purple. As the light grew brighter the entire tent began to glow. From the other side of the marble she watched as her body was held by the old man whose kind grin had turned to a malicious laugh. As she watched trapped inside the glass her body outside the marble began to jolt and jostle. With a deep gasp Alena body came to life. Alena watched in horror as the old man led the impostor who had stolen her body to the sounds of celebration. \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

Aliens had come to earth due to some sort of galactic terror, and humans had agreed to work with them if the aliens combined their technology with ours. Sadly, since their ship had crashed on earth, they could n't use any parts from the unsalvagable wreckage. Only what the aliens chose to bring. \n \n `` By means of defense,'' Nova, the head alien, gurgled. She had learned English the fastest, and therefore sufficed as a translator and the leader of the group. `` We have this.'' \n \n She withdrew a gun from her pocket. It was made of some type of white metal, and green glass allowed one to get a partial aerial view of the number of glowing green orbs in a chamber. She aimed the gun at the wall and fired. \n \n Like a flash of lightning, a green orb flew from the gun, with a string around its middle. The bullet-like object did n't get too far before being stopped by the string. Nova's eyes, which contained the same colors as the body of a peacock, held great embarrassment as she attempted to place the orb back into the gun. However, it cracked, gooey purple liquid oozing onto her rubber gloves as she quickly ate the remnants of the green bullet, almost as though she had consumed her shame. \n \n The alien's unnaturally pale skin flushed red all over, proclaiming to the world that she was flustered. `` I-It's a rather close-range weapon, but effective, in m-most cases!'' The creature explained, and the other aliens sat, confused as to what she was saying. \n \n The nation's top scientists exchanged glances, now understanding why this species was being threatened. \n \n `` I think it'll need a bit of work before we use it in battle.''\n"}

Because then I would have closure, been able to say `` we left each-other for this reason''. But I did n't get that. When I first found out, she grabbed her clothes and out daughter and left. No words. No goodbye. The other half - no - the entirety of my life suddenly and without warning left me. \n \n So for 2 1/2 years I have gotten through it. For 873 days, I have made myself trudge through the featureless, flat, futile experiment of life without her. \n \n Trudged is perhaps the wrong word. That implies the ability to walk, or even progress at all. Instead I fell flat on my face, barely keeping my head above the muck for long enough to take a gasp of air and refrain from asphyxiating myself in a mixture of alcohol and self-pity. There were days when I would wake up with no memory of what happened the night before; days when I would wake up 20 miles form my house and eve still days when I would wake up with a throng of people I had never met in my house. Whether it was my own version of postpartum depression or a product of excessive drinking I could never tell - it was most likely a mixture of both. \n \n Last night, however, changed al of this. I went through my daily routine, the one I had adapted to stop my already speedy descent into homelessness, and came home to finish out my day. I showered, ate, and got ready to go into the bed I used to share with the woman I loved. At some point during the night, after I had fallen asleep, I rolled over and felt something hard on the other side of the bed. A million different thoughts rushed through my head, foremost being that she had come back. \n \n Had she been too embarrassed to speak to me and instead climbed int my bed to continue things where they we so abruptly left? Had I drunkenly called her and asked her to come over and she obliged? \n \n As the millions of thoughts rushed through my head all in an instant, I began to caress her - something I so greatly missed. I still remembered every detail, every freckle and imperfection on her body. Her hair - she must have cut it short, this felt much different. It was much more course than I remember it being then too - maybe a product of the stress of her new life? \n \n But then my hands reached her body. Her skin, much rougher and less soft than I remembered. Her hips, much smaller? This made no sense. In my half-awake stupor, I turned don the light to investigate the changes that time had brought to the woman I still claimed to love. \n \n This woman was much different. Her skin cold and blue, her facial features marred by a slurry of makeup clearly messed up through tears. \n \n What had I done? What monster had I become? I could never do this to an innocent girl. This could n't have been me. \n \n Even if it was, me, it was her fault. Her fault for leaving me. I loved her, and I thought she loved me too. Look what she had done to me, what I had devolved into? I was a product of the mess she made in her wake. \n \n She would see that. I need to find her. I need to show her what she's done to me. This is her fault. I love her.

No... That's not it... AH! Super-ridiculous speed it seems like teleportation. Neat! \n \n `` I'm really sorry we've kept you so long this time.'' \n \n `` Ah, it's okay. It's a really nice facility you all have here. I never got to see more than the initial testing areas when I young, the expansions you've put in are amazing!'' \n \n `` Well, testing for superpowers is quite a necessity in society.'' \n \n `` I bet. So much requires them these days. And the requirement levels keep on getting higher.'' \n \n I sense something strange. It's from her... Her gaze. Those deep green eyes are intensely scanning me. I bet she has some super-sight or something like that. I met her gaze, I do n't think she's quite realized I'm looking back at her. I start checking my face with my hand, `` Oh? Do I have something on my face? Something in the teeth? I had a spinach wrap for lunch, I bet something is stuck in there-'' \n \n She blinks and realizes she's been staring, and immediately turns her head away and forward. I can see a flush of pink in cheeks. `` I- uh- y-y-you got it out.'' \n \n `` Ha, thanks.'' \n \n It's a quiet for a few moments as she regains her composure. \n \n `` Are you certain there was no one else around the crash site?'' \n \n `` Ummm... Yes. At least no one else I could see. Sorry, I do n't know any more. It was just me and whatever that thing was from all I know.'' \n \n `` It's okay. We've just been having someone going around defeating monsters and saving people... But we've never been able to find them... And you seem to be around these places more often that not.'' \n \n I could feel that strange sensation again. I briefly glance over, `` I could n't help but to notice, but those glasses really compliment your eyes.'' \n \n Another quick blink from her and she snaps her head back forward. This time she's flushed a nearly glowing red. \n \n We finally get out the front door and she's walked me up to the sidewalk right outside the gates. \n \n `` Well, Mr. Madison. The Organization appreciates your cooperativeness in helping us figure out these strange incidents.'' \n \n I smile and chuckle, `` Well, hopefully I stop having such horrible luck in being these situations. It's nice to see everyone, but I'd really like to meet in nicer circumstances-'' \n \n A loud tumbling crash interrupts as sedan rolls into the air, right at Mr. Madison and the scientist. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n She looks at the sedan and her mind races. The world slows down to a near standstill. The sedan is coming right at them. She lets go of her clipboard and it slowly descends as gravity acts upon it. Both arms wrap around Mr. Madison and she powers him out of the path of the sedan. She may not have super-strength, but fitness facilities at the Organization test facilities are rival to none and free access to employees. After what is mere moments to her and a fraction of a second to others, she's cleared the path of airborne sedan- \n \n Her arms momentarily move and something slips out of them. She feels nothing. She feels she's grabbing onto... Air? A glance still shows Mr. Madison being pulled along looking towards something- Is he becoming transparent?! What is he looking at- OH NO! \n \n She looks in front of the path of the sedan and sees bystanders just now trying to react to the car about to hit them- Did it just jump back into the air?! \n \n The sedan pitches back up into the air and is now on a path to go safely over the bystanders and land into empty roadway. She studies this... And as the scene slowly progresses, a faint bright orange trail leaves her going to the point where the car sharply pitched up, and then the trails goes too... The villain who threw it?! The villain for some reason is flying backwards with his face contorting from something smacking him- WHAT THE HELL?! For a brief moment she swears Mr. Madison in her arms is almost transparent and her arms are going through him?! \n \n Then, Mr. Madison returns to full opacity, her arms shake a bit. Then for a few more moments the odd blur around Mr. Madison dissipates. \n \n Her mind slows back down and the world goes back to full speed. The sedan bounces over the bystanders and safely lands. The villain spins backwards onto the pavement, completely knocked out, much to the surprise and shock of the heroes who were fighting him. They can only look at each other in confusion at why the villain is now sprawled out, unconscious on the ground. She feels that Mr. Madison has regained his footing and she lets go of him. \n \n He looks around at the scene, `` Wow! You got me clear of that in a hurry! That was amazing! Do you have super-strength or something?! I mean, I'm not exactly light and all-'' \n \n She holds back the urge to use her enhanced sight on Mr. Madison. He's being nice and complimenting. A sly smirk grows on her face, and she reaches into her lab coat's front pocket to pull out one of her business cards, along with a pen. She turns over to the blank side and writes something quickly. \n \n She presents the business side of the card to Mr. Madison, `` As usual, Mr. Madison, here's my business card should you need to report anything more...'' \n \n He reaches to take it... `` Well, Ms. McMalloy, I will definitely-'' \n \n She flips the card over, `` And if you'd like to meet in better circumstances, here's my contact information.'' \n \n Mr. Madison's freezes mid grab. Ms. McMalloy calmly places the card between his fingers, and closes them onto the card. She confidently walks around to the side of him, `` Oh, you can call me by my middle name Cynthia.'' \n \n Cynthia looks over at the stunned look on Mr. Madison's face, as he blushes and seems to be at a complete loss to react. The sly smirk grows to a devilish grin. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n By the time I regained my senses, she was well inside Organization's facility and I'm standing in the middle of the street. Despite all the activity around me, I could only look at the business card with Cynthia's personal phone number and e-mail address. \n \n `` Huh...'' \n\n"}

Did cavemen in their paleolithic squalor ever strive for cover from pebbles and sharpened twigs? Does a paramecium shield its face from the extending pseudopods of an amoeba? Perhaps one does not need to hide from flint and cytoplasm; perhaps it is just as meaningless to do so as it is against 10,000,000 tons of hard, atomic fury. But Its hard to figure in the face of nuclear armageddon.

The permeability of life, it sticks like a fly on tape, but now I find myself wondering if it is not, in fact, a web. Is it worth it to survive when our ends loom around us like spiders in the dark, waiting to turn our corpses into liquid nothingness? And now I remember the fly, and the caveman, and the paramecium, and was there any other promise made to any of them before? I stand up, open the cabinet, take the damn toothpaste from the bottom shelf, the nail-clippers, the cologne... I open the door. Death grows like a mushroom, but we do n't need sunlight anymore.\n"}

And perhaps I never should have tried.'' \n \n `` *Saved*?'' The word was bitter and bile in Casper's mouth. `` Have you any idea of the lives you've taken? The blood you've spilled?'' \n \n `` Yes, yes, of course.'' The Emperor swept a thin hand down across the dais. `` There. Penbrook. My most honorable man-at-arms. He was a smithy when I met him, if you can believe that. A good one, as well. A good *man*. Four children. Beautiful, courageous Eileen back home. He loved darts. Had no taste for gambling. Painted. Worried about my health. Worried about this kingdom. A good man.'' The Emperor nodded. `` Dead. All of them, dead. My men. *Your* men. Your horse - a beautiful horse, I should add. And brave. I saw the way it leapt across the fiery moat. No other horse would do such a thing.'' \n \n `` Dead defending you,'' said Casper, cold, barely above a whisper. `` Dead trying to *kill* you. Dead because of you and the horrors you have unleashed upon this land.'' \n \n `` Certainly,'' said the Emperor. `` And I do n't suppose you could be convinced to allow me to continue as I was, eh?'' \n \n Casper laughed, nearly weeping with exhaustion and spoiled anxiety. `` I never would have guessed you'd have a sense of humor.'' He drew a deep breath and leveled his sword. `` But I guess I do n't have much room in my heart for laughter these days.'' \n \n The Emperor smiled, careful eyes never leaving Casper's face. `` I would n't go so far as to say that the things I've done have been justified, but it seems it would serve us both to understand what's at stake.'' \n \n `` Your death,'' said Casper mildly, advancing on the older man. `` That is the only thing left on the table. Your reign of terror ends today.'' \n \n `` I've seen the world - what it becomes,'' said the Emperor hastily, drawing back in his chair. `` I've seen the future. I see it every night when I close my eyes.'' \n \n `` I'm not concerned with the future,'' said Casper. `` Everyone I've ever loved is dead. My home is half in ruin. What do your nightmares mean to me?'' \n \n `` The *world*,'' said the Gray Emperor, clutching at the arms of his throne. `` You have no idea what it wants to become. No matter what hell you think I've made here on Earth, you must believe me when I tell how much *worse* it threatens to become.'' \n \n `` Worse than murder?'' said Casper. `` Villages burned to the ground? Bloodlines *erased*? Worse than that?'' \n \n The Emperor sighed. `` I do n't suppose I would ever be able to convince you, but the things I have seen... they are haunting in ways you could not imagine. What human beings become... what they do to one another...'' \n \n `` I have seen the worst of what a human may do.'' \n \n `` Then imagine *demons*!'' shouted the Emperor. `` Imagine wraiths! Imagine soulless abominations. Feeling nothing. Being nothing. Simply consuming. Ravaging. Anything and everything. Until there is nothing. Because *that* is what I see. *That* is what man strives to make of himself. \n \n `` I am not a godly man and I do not consider my works holy in any way, but know that the evil I do, I do for the better sake of all mankind. It is a protection. A benediction. I am the evil of the world. I give men like you focus. Hunger. Ambition. I am the lone demon in the dark. And when I am gone, there will be no evil but the evil inside your hearts. The world will be overrun with apathy. No one will be spared.'' \n \n The Emperor took a slow, steadying breath. Casper watched the old man sweat and shake. \n \n `` What you describe sounds like freedom,'' said Casper after some time. \n \n `` It is Hell,'' said the Emperor. \n \n `` And what if it was just a bad dream?'' \n \n The Emperor considered this for some time. `` Then I suppose this must be part of the dream, because what torment could be worse than to have done what I've done... and been wrong?'' \n \n Casper placed the tip of his sword under the Emperor's neck. \n \n `` Should I wake you?'' \n \n There was a drip somewhere in the room. Leaking blood. \n \n `` You wo n't ever know I was wrong,'' said the Emperor. `` Nor will your children. Or even their children. The future I have tangled with is a far one. Only they will know whether I was mad or not. But I suspect they will never know about this, will they? To them I will be nothing more than a blood-thirsty tyrant or - worse - forgotten entirely.'' \n \n `` Ah,'' said Casper. `` You *do* have farsight.'' \n \n `` It would be a mistake to forget what I have said. To forget my reasons. Nothing would be learned.'' \n \n `` There is plenty to learn,'' whispered Casper, as the tip of his sword plunged slowly, silently into the old man's neck. `` How to kill a tyrant. How to free a country. How to start again. There is no end to the lessons they will learn about this day. But none of them will be about you, and you man-at-arms, and your *dreams*. Not a one.'' \n \n Casper's word was good. No one else ever knew of the conversation the young man shared with the deceased emperor, and over time the tyrannical despot lost his color and his shape. He became a bogeyman. Then he became a joke. And finally he became nothing at all. But so too did Casper. And other men had dreams. And other men stormed other castles. And on... and on... and on... \n \n In the end, neither was wrong.\n"}

{"prompt": "Three, sharp knocks on the door. Brian, spooked, took a deep, careful exhale as he paused his work. He climbed down", "human": "Three, sharp knocks on the door. Brian, spooked, took a deep, careful exhale as he paused his work. He climbed down from his precarious seating atop the cupboards, down to the living room floor, and tiptoed over to greet the unexpected guest. When he pulled the door open, a stern man in a black uniform stood on the other side. He had a blue patch on one shoulder. Not a normal cop, then. A census regulator. \n \n `` Mr. Brian Fisher?'' the officer stated. \n \n `` Yes, that's me. Not so loud, please!'' he replied in a respectful but hushed tone. \n \n The officer's brow furrowed as he glanced behind Brian to see what the cause for concern was. \n \n `` My name is Officer Morris,'' he continued, voice only a hint quieter now. `` Are you aware that your termination date was yesterday? You failed to report to the office.'' \n \n Brian gulped, heart rate rising. `` What? No, that ca n't be right! My termination is n't supposed to be until sometime next week!'' \n \n `` Boy, never heard that one before.'' \n \n `` No, really! I'm completely serious. Look, I'll get my papers. Why do n't you come in?'' He held the door open wide enough for the officer. As he stepped in, Brian held a hand out, suddenly frantic. `` Oh, wait, you have shoes on. Give me one second. Delicate matters, you see.'' \n \n Brian paced back into the room, looking for anything lose somebody might step on if they were n't careful. There was nothing, as expected, but it did n't hurt to be cautious. \n \n `` Okay,'' Brian said, returning to the front door. `` You can come in, just please tread lightly. And if you go upstairs, you have to take your shoes off and be extra careful. No sudden movements of any kind. I'm sure it's quite unconventional for you, but my house, my rules.'' \n \n The officer gave him a raised eyebrow at that, but he just shrugged in response. He stepped into the house, and was finally able to see what Brian was so worked up about. \n \n Throughout the entire room, and branching off down the hallway and up the stairs, was an enormous card castle that took up the majority of the living space, even floor to ceiling. \n \n `` Whoa,'' Officer Morris breathed. \n \n `` Beautiful, is n't it? My life's work. This last project has taken me over forty years, you know. If I go according to schedule, I'll finally reclaim my title as the world record holder for the largest single playing card structure. That's why I ca n't die today, you see. I'm not quite finished.'' \n \n The officer had by now regained his composure. `` You do all of this by yourself?'' \n \n Brian nodded. `` Had to. If it's a group project that's an entirely different world record. Me and Jeremy Settle, some guy in Germany have been having a competition these past few hundred years over who can build the biggest castle. He's held the record these last twenty five years after my old castle broke, but his termination date was two years ago, so I'll have the last laugh! You know, this castle has over two million individual cards so far. It even goes out onto the backyard patio! I have it screened so the wind ca n't affect it, you see. You'll probably be the last one to see it unfinished, actually. I could give you a tour if you're --'' \n \n `` Sir,'' the officer interrupted. `` This is quite impressive, but I must inform you that my papers say your termination was due yesterday.'' \n \n `` Oh!'' Brian jumped. `` That's right. I almost forgot. My papers are upstairs. Wait here.'' Without any hesitation, he bolted up the stairs, careful to avoid the trail of stacked cards that led up one side of them. \n \n The officer took the time to examine the castle. There were no couches in the living room. In fact, the furniture it was built around and on top of all had flat surfaces. It was stacked atop the cupboards, into the kitchen, and was complete with towers and elaborate sculptures. The living room had the largest stack. It nearly reached the ceiling, and the cards in the center were surrounded by more cards. You could n't reach them now, meaning they had to be placed first. Officer Morris wondered how old those cards were. \n \n As he looked at the cards at the base of the stairs, he noticed irregular markings on them. He leaned in to inspect one and noticed it was a number. Upon further investigation, every card seemed to have numbers, and most of the nearby ones were seven digits long. In a world where death was so hard to achieve it had to be enforced, he could n't blame people for finding odd ways to spend their lives. He had once met somebody that collected every scent of candle imaginable. She had them organized and everything. Her house, not surprisingly, smelled terrible. \n \n Brian came down the stairs with a stack of papers in his hands, frowning. He looked up to notice the officer leaning in close to the cards and his eyes went wide in a panic. \n \n `` What are you doing! That's too close! You might have to sneeze or breathe or --'' In his frenzy to rush down the stairs, he tripped. Falling face first, he tumbled down the remaining steps, crashing into both the officer and the cards he had been inspecting. \n \n Without so much as a thought of concern for either person, Brian immediately stood to check the damage. \n \n And watched as, like dominoes, the card castle toppled down, flowing over itself and the furniture like a torrent of water cascading into an empty valley. It crashed to the floor, but the chaos continued it sought the other rooms in the house. \n \n Brian's despair was all but tangible. The officer could n't help but pity the man. \n \n But then, forgotten on the floor, he saw his termination papers, and at the top was one big, bolded date. \n \n Yesterday's. \n \n `` Well,'' Brian said. `` I guess there's no point in even trying to plead for more time. I have nothing left to live for.''\n"}

Manager said they were losing too much money, that they were sorry to see me go... gave me the whole spiel. Said he'd pay me double if I closed up shop tonight, but after today, I'm not to return.'' I squinted at my audience, a drunken college girl with her head on the bar, who seemed to barely process what I was saying. I sighed. \n \n `` Speaking of which, it's closing time. Get out now, I'll call a cab for you.'' The girl nodded numbly. After I ushered her out the door, I began the mind-numbing routine of closing up shop. I scrubbed down the tables, put up the stools, mopped the floors. I began emptying the leftover beer mugs when I caught my reflection in the smooth, curved surface. An unfamiliar, rugged face stared back at me. How far I've come.... \n \n `` Dr. Frost,'' came a man's voice from behind me. I froze. It had been years since I'd heard that name. Memories flashed before my eyes... a woman on fire, my laboratory in ruins, government officials amidst a sea of sirens, sifting among the scientists' broken bodies, no doubt looking for mine.... \n \n I did n't turn around, but I was instantly on edge. Slowly I turned the mug in my hand, and caught the reflection of a shadow behind me. From the reflection on the glass and the sound of his voice, the man was standing perhaps six or seven feet away from my back. \n \n `` I do n't know that name,'' I said, my voice sharp. `` Bar's closed. Please leave.'' The man laughed, and the sound of it was strangely familiar. \n \n `` I'm afraid I need your help, Frost. It would be a lot easier if you would come with me willingly. Otherwise...'' I heard a metallic *click* as the man readied a gun. \n \n I looked down into the mug in my hand. There was still a good amount of beer left. I kept my movements slow and deliberate as I raised the mug to my lips and took a sip. I grimaced. \n \n `` That's nasty stuff,'' I murmured. \n \n `` Enough games, doc,'' said the gunman, an irritated edge creeping into his voice. `` Come with me.'' I whirled around and tossed the remnants of the beer at the gunman's hand. It instantly froze, encasing his fingers and the trigger in a block of frozen alcohol. Strangely, the gunman smiled at me from behind a ski mask. \n \n `` Very good, Frost,'' he said, his voice still hauntingly familiar. `` I was afraid you'd lost your touch.'' I reached out and ripped the mask from his face. A wild-haired young man with sharp green eyes grinned back at me. \n \n `` Baines,'' I hissed. `` I should've recognized you from the start. If you're here, that means *she's* here...'' I looked wildly around the room, ready to spring into action. But Baines shook his head. \n \n `` Ah, see. That's the problem,'' he began. `` Pyra's not here tonight. I'm here on my own, playing the role of the dutiful henchman. As I said, I need your help. Or rather, *Pyra* needs your help.'' I stared at him disbelievingly for a second, then threw back my head and laughed. \n \n *'' Pyra* needs *my* help?'' I repeated. `` Does she not understand the meaning of archenemies?'' \n \n `` These are special circumstances,'' said Baines, his voice grim. `` We have a common enemy this time. By the way, could you unfreeze my hand, please? It's getting a bit chilly in there.'' He glanced meaningfully a the block of ice that still encased his outstretched right hand. I frowned and tapped the ice. It instantly melted, and the gun fell uselessly to the floor in a puddle of alcohol. \n \n `` I'm gon na have to clean that up now, no thanks to you,'' I grumbled. I crossed to the other side of the bar and grabbed a mop from the wall. Baines delicately massaged his fingers, looking up at me curiously. \n \n `` Never thought of you as a bartender, Doc,'' he said, his voice questioning. \n \n `` Everyone else sees me as one,'' I said. `` You should start thinking the same way.'' \n \n `` She misses you, you know,'' Baines blurted out. I glanced at him, raising an eyebrow. He lowered his voice conspiratorially. `` Probably overstepping my role as a lowly henchman here, but she liked having you as a challenge. She'd been getting bored lately... a bit careless... I guess that's how she got caught.'' I stopped mopping the floor. \n \n `` Pyra got caught?'' I repeated. I thought of my arch nemesis, pictured her laughing wildly as she shot pillars of flames from both hands. She was crazy. Unpredictable, probably the main reason she'd never been caught before. `` By who?'' \n \n `` The government.'' \n \n `` So you want me to help her break out?'' I snorted. I mopped up the rest of the alcohol. `` Yeah, right. I swore to myself I would n't do the whole'Dr. Frost' thing anymore, in case you have n't noticed.'' \n \n `` You have to help,'' said Baines, his voice insistent. Almost pleading. `` The government... they're trying to make more superhumans. They're going to run tests on her. Horrible tests. And they would've done the same to you, if they could find you, and you know it. Superhero or supervillain, it does n't matter to them. They're just after your DNA. That's why they attacked your laboratory seven years ago.'' I slowly set the mop aside, and leaned on the bar, burying my face in my hands. \n \n `` Good God, Baines,'' I sighed. `` I'm just a bartender.'' Then I remembered that I had just been fired. `` Not even that anymore.'' \n \n `` No.'' The firmness in the henchman's voice made me look up. `` You're more than that. You're Dr. Frost. That's the man I saw tonight, when you froze my hand in a block of solid ice. You want revenge, right? You want to get back at the government for destroying your lab, your life's work, for killing your whole team.... Well. We'll get back at them together. But we need more... firepower.'' He smiled as he said this, and I rolled my eyes. `` So the first step is to break Pyra out.'' I looked away and sighed, but a reluctant smile played on the corner of my lips. \n \n `` That was a good speech,'' I admitted. `` You'll grow up to be an excellent monolouging super villain one day.'' Baines almost seemed to blush with the praise. I straightened and clapped my hands together. \n \n `` So,'' I said. `` Where is she?'' \n \n `` North Point Base,'' said the henchman, an excited glint in his eyes. \n \n `` God,'' I scowled. That was where the government had accidentally given me my powers. `` Back to the start, eh? I swore I'd never go back to that place.'' \n \n `` You probably never imagined you'd be saving your arch nemesis either,'' Baines pointed out with a wry smile. \n \n `` True,'' I conceded. `` Let me go find my suit... I think it's collecting dust somewhere in the cellar... then we'll be off.''\n"}
{"prompt": "`` Remember, Google is always watching.'' \n \n The advertisement flew by, piercing eyes drawn into the O's of the word Google. I continued on,", "human": "`` Remember, Google is always watching.'' \n \n The advertisement flew by, piercing eyes drawn into the O's of the word Google. I continued on, cruising the expressway on my cycle. \n \n Back in the days where competition was allowed, where people did n't *have* to use Google for all of their needs, I was one of the greatest competitors. I even managed to fund a few national ads and some bogus studies saying people preferred me to them. \n \n It was just a matter of time till I took reign. I was the underdog, and I like it that way. \n \n I was the Daniel-san to Google's Cobra Kai. It was only a matter of time, and an illegal crane kick to the chin, that would show the world my true place. \n \n `` Are you ready, Bing?'' \n \n I looked at the man next to me. He was lanky, with a pasty complexion and overall undesirable air about him. Oh well, you do n't get your pick of the litter for a job like this. \n \n `` Of course, I been waiting for this day since July 27, 2036.'' \n \n July 27, 2036. \n \n That was the day when Google changed the world. \n \n That was the day they bought the US Government. \n \n Really, we all should have seen it coming. After all, the government was millions of trillions of dollars in debt. It is n't like they were n't looking to be bought out. But only Google had the stones to pull it off. Only they had the influence, capital, and user loyalty to make such a transaction profitable. \n \n `` Here he comes.'' noted my lanky, pasty comrade. \n \n Google walked out of the White House doors to the adorning cheers of the citizens. Ever since Google took over, the United States of Google's GDP had quadrupled. Salaries were up, unemployment was down, and people were grateful. \n \n If only they knew how he did it. \n \n `` Let's go.'' \n \n I dived out of the window, extending my bionic glider attachments. I soared through the air as if I had wings, bullets from the Secret Services snipers whizzing past my head. \n \n The closer I got, the more fire I was under. Eventually, they were able to wing my left bicep.

{"prompt": "`` Where the fuck are my keys?'' Johnny said to nobody in particular. He stuffed his hands in his pockets and came out with a phone,", "human": "`` Where the fuck are my keys?'' Johnny said to nobody in particular. He stuffed his hands in his pockets and came out with a phone, some loose change and a couple of old sweet wrappers. For the third time this week. \n `` For fucks sake...'' Johnny sighed. He was going to have to go back to the lobby and find someone to let him in to his flat. He turned to see the elevator doors close in front of him. \n `` You could n't have waited five more seconds?'' He yelled at the descending metal box. He was going to have to walk. Down nine flights of stairs. *What exactly did I do to deserve this? * he thought to himself. *I'm a doctor. I save people's lives! Why am I having the worst week of my life? * There really was n't an explanation. It had all started with the traffic jam last Thursday, and then there had been the problems with his WiFi router, the keys, the disappearing change and the lack of a headphone jack on the new iPhone. It felt like someone up there was playing a game with him- who can make Johnny have a mental breakdown the fastest? Well, someone was winning. Johnny did n't think he could take much more... *Gone on break. Back in half an hour. * \n `` Fuck's sake...'' Johnny sighed for what felt like the millionth time that week. \n \n As a matter of fact, someone up there was messing with him. Me. I admit, it was a little cruel, but it was a good job, and you did n't last long in hell without a cruel streak. Not that I really wanted to stay down there any more- I was a little bored of torturing the souls of the evil. I mean, there are only so many times shoving a large spike into someone is funny, you know? So yes, I took the job. I do n't know who it was from. I just got a message on my phone one day asking me to take a surface job. I was genuinely curious - surface jobs could be big, world changing even, and usually it was the angels who got up to that sort of thing. Frankly, fire and brimstone gets a little tiresome after a couple years. I wanted some fresh air. \n \n It was a big apartment building in town. Nice, modern. The guy was clearly successful. `` So who's the client?'' I asked myself. Nobody heard. Us celestial beings are invisible to the rest of them. There was n't anyone from heaven or hell around that I could see, meaning my client was high ranking. It was certainly interesting. \n `` I hope you're as evil as you are smart.'' Said a voice next to me. \n `` I presume you're my client?'' I said to the air. The person, whoever it was, was hiding well. \n `` I'm used to hiding.'' It said. `` And knowing what people are thinking.'' \n `` So this is an actual job?'' I asked. `` I'm being paid to annoy someone?'' \n `` Essentially, yes. You need to annoy this guy as much as you can.'' \n `` Are you sure you do n't just want me to severely depress the guy?'' I asked. \n `` No. I do n't want him dying and getting in to heaven.'' The voice said. \n `` Jesus. What did this guy to do you?'' \n Silence. \n `` Hello?'' \n The voice was gone. \n \n `` I could have sworn I had a dollar.'' Johnny muttered to himself. He'd only had ninety eight cents. I'd made sure of that. Johnny was looking really down, and I had to feel sorry for the guy. I'd been following him around, and he seemed like a really nice guy. He saved lives for a living, for crying out loud! For the millionth time, I wondered what he'd done to deserve this. Someone out there was really mad at this guy. But I was just doing my job- which reminded me. The woman at the desk had come back five minutes ago- something I should probably fix. I quickly filled her bladder and she dutifully got up and went to go. That taken care of, I turned to see Johnny walk in to the building, checking his phone. He smiled at something, then turned straight towards the elevator. He caught me off guard, and he was through the metal doors before I could close them, humming as he went. I had to do something, quick! If the client saw Johnny behaving like this... \n I floated up through the roof of the elevator and jammed the mechanism on the top. Johnny was n't going anywhere for a while. \n \n Inside the lift, Johnny felt the bump as the lift stopped. The doors did n't open. He was stuck. Johnny looked up at the ceiling disbelievingly. The, Johnny sat down in the corner of the lift and cried. \n \n `` You did a good job.'' The voice was back. \n `` No. It was a bad job. A horrible one, actually. What *did* that guy do to you?'' \n The voice sighed. And then materialised in to the last thing I would have expected - an angel. But not a happy one. His robes were dirty and torn ( despite being magical - I really do n't know how he did it ), his wings were moulting and his halo was barely glowing at all. \n `` You're an angel?'' I asked, surprised. \n `` A soul carrier, to be precise. I kill people and take them for judgement.'' \n `` I thought you were good guys?'' Soul carriers were supposed to be happy - a fresh start, a welcome to the afterlife. This guy looked more like someone who would take himself to the pearly gates than someone who led other people there. \n `` So did I. But do you have any idea how depressing it is to see death wherever you go?'' He sighed. \n I nodded sympathetically. `` But why this guy?'' \n `` I was down on earth a couple months ago. Alive, I mean. I had everything. A good job, beautiful girlfriend. We were going to be married.'' He looked to be on the verge of tears. `` And then there was an accident - and electric shock. I was dead before I knew it. And we were both alone.'' \n I nodded again. Sometimes it was hard to know who death was harder on - those who were left below, or those who watched friends and family from the other side, with no way of contacting them. Just watching. \n `` Then, last week, there was a car crash. She was in it. A huge pile up - she was unconscious, and bleeding out. She was going to die, for sure. I could n't wait to see her again. And then the paramedics came. And *he* saved her. I wo n't see her again, maybe not for decades. I'm stuck up here, and it's his fault I ca n't see her.'' The angel was crying now, pearly white tears pouring off his face. It had started raining outside, too. The angels always had the weather on their side. \n `` So you take it out on him?'' I asked. `` That does n't seem fair.'' \n `` Trust me.'' The angle said. `` If I could kill myself, I already would have.'' \n He melted off into nothing. I knew the full story now. Johnny was a good guy, and I could n't keep doing this to him. But what had happened to the angel was even crueller. I floated over the crying man, split as to what to do. Then I restarted the mechanism, and floated off in to the night. \n \n It was gone eight when Sally heard the doorbell ring. She was surprised - she had n't been getting many visitors since Tom died. She walked to the door, cautious. There was a man standing there, with sunglasses and a leather jacket. \n `` Can I help you?'' She asked. The rain was pouring down. \n `` No. But there is someone else who needs you.'' He said. Then he pulled out a gun. Sally turned to close the door, but the man blocked her. \n `` I'm really sorry about this.'' He said, and then he shot her in the face. \n And from behind a big apartment building in town, the sun began to shine once more. \n \n \n \n\n"}

I was too drunk for much perceptiveness, but I was pretty positive he'd tickled my ribcage before returning to his position beside the coat rack. \n \n `` Thank you,'' I said. \n \n `` Do n't mention it,'' he replied. No eye contact. \n \n My date had left several minutes ago in a rage, but I was n't going to waste any of the food she'd bothered to order, nor any of the wine she hinted I buy. A whole bottle of Seins Ivres and I did n't even like red wine. Still, I drank the bottle. \n \n I could n't remember what I said that finally pushed her to leave. She'd muttered something about my misociginy before slapping me and taking off. Her coat hung there on the rack, but I did n't get it for her. If she wanted it, she could come get it. Maybe she'd leave a tip, since I did n't. \n \n I was a block down the road before hearing the soft jingle of keys, muffled by the thick material of the coat. My keys were in my pocket, so I wondered whose keys I had. I shoved one numb hand into the left pocket and felt around. A few tumbleweeds of lint and a lighter greeted me. My right hand found the keys in its corresponding pocket. \n \n They were for the Ritz a few blocks down. I'd decidedly been given the wrong jacket, seeing that I did n't smoke nor was I staying at the Ritz. My dilemma was not: `` Should I bring the jacket back,'' but `` Should I bring it back tonight.'' After all, I was going home alone anyway. I might as well spend it in someone else's room. They might not make it back anyway. \n \n Those were the drunk thoughts that clouded my internal navigation. By the time I'd looked up, I was three blocks from either the Ritz or the restaurant and not in walkable distance to my own, real home. In fact, I was n't sure where I was at all, but most of the buildings were boarded up. \n \n I could n't tell if I felt it or heard it first, but they both registered as a whole. A gunshot. Simple, low-caliber. Maybe not meant to kill me, since I had n't died, but I sure enough fell on my face. From where I was laying, I thought the bullet was lodged in my hip. \n \n Some dress-shoed footsteps tapped up beside me and flipped me over with a kick. Even if I wanted to see who was attacking me, I could n't. A streetlight shadowed their faces from above. Or maybe it was Heaven, reaching down to me. \n \n `` It's not him,'' one of them said. \n \n `` What do you mean?'' the other said. `` That's his jacket. It's got his damn initials sewn in the back.'' \n \n `` This guy must've stolen it.'' \n \n `` Shit. Do we kill him?'' \n \n `` That's not really our business. He might die anyway.'' \n \n `` I do n't think so. Just give him a good kick and we'll head back around.'' \n \n `` Right.'' \n \n Things went black for a while. Probably longer than usual, since I'd hit peak inebriation on the walk home. Not enough to forget what happened, just enough to sleep through the pain. I do remember, in that sleep, I dreamt my date tried to meet me back at the restaurant, but I was gone. There was no regret on her face, but curiosity. \n \n I awoke in a different jacket, my jacket, but the blood had seeped through still. There was no lighter in my left pocket, but there was something in my right pocket. A tightly folded piece of paper with initials signed on the front. Inside it read: \n \n `` Dear Kind Stranger, \n Thank you for borrowing my jacket for a bit. I knew I was being followed, but I was n't sure by whom. You can rest assured knowing that I've taken care of your aggressors and returned your jacket. I'm deeply sorrowed that you had to take a bullet for all of this nonsense, and sorrowed further that I have no way to compensate you for now. Maybe someday, I can repay you. \n Farewell for now, An Unkind Stranger'' \n \n Even with the hangover, I was fascinated by whatever I'd been a part of. Mostly curious, but fascinated. Even there, in the cold concrete of the forgotten street I'd stumbled down, I did n't feel so bad about the bullet in my side. Especially at the thought of future compensation. \n\n"}

The war started like any other, two small nations had a border conflict, he could n't even remember their names. Maybe one had a B in it, or was it an F? It did n't matter now, all that mattered was that one had nuclear capabilities, and they used them. \n \n After that, the world was one giant ball of radiation. The United Nations had tried to calm the world down, but nations allied to the unfortunate nation to suffer nuclear assault quickly responded with their own arsenals. Within three months, radiation had spread all over Europe, nations that were angry with the result of other nation's folly decided that if they should go down, nobody would be left to watch. It was Russia first. \n \n They were followed by China, then England, then India and Pakistan. Iran did n't want to miss its chance and soon Israel was obliterated. Six months later ISIS had achieved nuclear capabilities after they capitalized on the weakness and instability of the region. America was attacked. The world population dropped dramatically, disease and famine spread across every continent. Sea levels rose, countries disintegrated, and communications fell out. \n \n Now Greg, with his small group of five, being himself, his brother John, girlfriend Stacy, best friend Allen, and his brother's wife Sara, wandered what remained of America looking for food and shelter. Only a very few times did they run across anybody, those encounters always resulted in death. \n \n While they walked, they passed broken down cars, destroyed homes, and road systems around towns that no longer stood. The nearest weapon discharge was in Indianapolis, but the devastation spread far. A bronze colored plaque stood about a hundred feet away, Greg moved faster, hoping to find something worthwhile, however low the possibility. \n \n When they reached the sign it was nearly illegible. After some time, John finally finished deciphering it ( it had been awhile since anyone had to read, and John remembered it best ). \n \n John approached the group, they were assembled around a small fire, cooking a can of beans, enough for the whole day. `` It says something about a fort'' said John. `` I think it's Fort Knox, but i am pretty sure that's in Nevada.'' \n \n `` No John, it's in Kentucky'' retorted Allen, upset with the stupidity John always displayed. \n \n `` Fort Knox? That's the place made of gold right?'' Asked Stacy, a smirk on her face, she pushed Allen's buttons often. \n \n `` Where is it?'' inquired Greg, ecstatic at the mention of gold. Greg was a businessman, obsessed with money and profits. \n \n `` Not far, 5 miles it says'' John replied. \n \n `` Let's go then!'' Exclaimed Greg, `` That place probably has some cool government stuff.'' \n \n Now the five walked down the road, passing the can of beans along to each other, eating just one spoonful at a time. After two hours they reached the place the plaque spoke about. A large complex with multiple fences, and nobody in sight. \n \n `` There's nothing for us there Greg, lets just keep going'' said John. \n \n `` No, we're going in''. Greg moved for the small car gate in front of the guard booth. When he reached it Greg could hear a whirring noise, he could n't quite place it. He looked into the booth and there it was, a small fan, spinning. This place had electricity. This could be a place they could live, but Greg did n't care about that, he wanted the gold, he imagined huge vaults full of gold. \n \n The group reluctantly followed Greg over the barricades, and approached the door, which seemed to be made of solid gold. They tried the door. \n \n `` Locked'' said Greg. \n \n `` No way we're getting in, better just leave.'' It was obvious Sara did n't want to be here. \n \n `` Nah'' said Greg `` There's a way in, we just have to get creative. `` Greg walked down the steps and started across the lawn. It was at that point that a loud alarm was sounded. A gun sprouted from the ground, and concrete slid away from the corners of the building to reveal more of the weapons. Sara, who had been standing on the path, began to run towards the entrance to the complex, Greg hit the ground and covered his head. John, Allen, and Stacy hid in the alcove in front of the door. \n \n The guns began to fire, Greg's ears rang loudly, but soon the fire died down. Greg was not hurt, he was very surprised. He stood and started back towards the walkway. \n \n `` I'm fine, it's ok, it did n't hit me!'' John stood, relieved he was n't dead, but then his eyes fell on the pathway to the entrance, where Sara laid, riddled with bullets. \n \n `` Sara!'' John ran to her lifeless body. It did n't move, she said nothing, she was gone. \n \n Without saying a word, John drew a pistol from his bag and shot himself right there. The three were mortified, Allen stood with a look of shock on his face, Stacy began sobbing uncontrollably. Greg felt nothing, he never like John, and he thought Sara was a bitch. \n \n Greg began towards the booth, stepping carelessly over the bodies of John and Sara. when he reached the booth there was a control panel. He had to bust the thing open, but there was a lock control. He opened the front door, and entered the building and explored what he could reach. The locked doors appeared quickly, and his exploration was stemmed for the time being. \n \n For three days Greg explored the building, Stacy and Allen refused to speak to him, they blamed him for Sara's death. When he found another security room he did n't tell Allen or Stacy, he just began toying with the controls. He found a key, and a keyhole on the control board. \n \n When he tested the key, an alarm began blaring. The key worked though, and he heard a voice over the intercom, robotic, it said `` Vault Open, Enter Now''. \n \n Greg was thrilled, the alarm still blaring, he entered the hallway, the door at the end was now open. He entered and began walking down a long hallway with multiple doors, but all of them were open. The doors were mad of a thick, bright metal. He inspected each room, marked with a different number, 1-25. No room held any gold save for room 25, a single gold bar lay on the ground in the middle of the room, a note on top. It read `` Enjoy!'' \n \n At this time Greg heard gunfire. He ran to the vault door and peaked around the corner, Stacy was running down the hall with Allen close behind. \n \n `` Greg!!! Help, people are here, they are shooting at us!'' Allen had a Rifle in his hands, Stacy had a small pistol. Without waiting for much time, Greg closed the door to the vault hall. He walked quietly down the hall to vault 25, he retrieved the single gold bar from the floor. \n \n Greg walked to the security room at the end of the hall and entered. He turned on the small monitor that viewed the hall outside the Vault hall door. He could see Stacy pounding on the door, Allen at the other end of the hall firing a gun, he turned the speaker up. \n \n Stacy was yelling for him to let them in, Allen was firing rounds in quick succession. Then Allen fell over, blood poured from his limp body. Stacy was screaming louder now. Three men in black suits and gas masks turned the corner and moved quickly towards Stacy. She turned and pulled the small pistol from her belt. She fired 5 rounds before the men reacted. She hit all three. One was shot in the throat, another took two shots to the leg, the third was hit twice in the chest. \n \n The man with bullets in his leg pulled his own weapon and shot Stacy once in her hip, she fell hard to the ground and her gun slid away. The man approached her, put his gun to her head, and pulled the trigger. He stood for a few moments, looking at the dead girl on the floor, then he turned to the camera and uttered a single word. `` Enjoy!''. He turned and walked away. \n \n Greg turned off the screen and walked away. He retrieved his bag, took out a blanket, and slept on the floor, holding a bar of gold close to his face, with a clean conscience. \n \n Edit: Jogn changed to John\n"}

It was a stiflingly hot day, and she had been in the sun re-reading that second work draft for too long. It was due this afternoon, and so were about ten million other things. They had hated her first draft. The office was too hot, too crowded. She came out to the park to breathe. She must have fallen asleep on the bench and was dreaming. God knows she needed the sleep. Now in her twenties, with a job that loved her too much, her own projects on the side and an apartment she hardly ever left the office for, she was too rational and, yes, grown-up to be seeing this. Maybe it was one of those lucid dream things. But she wasn ’ t asleep. And there she was, standing right there. Rosaline. \n \n “ Ava, I ’ ve *missed* you! ” The girl gasped, her breath short from running. \n \n “ Hi! ” Ava tried to be casual, “ My name is Ava.

Even Old Tom, fifteen, had never touched a girl before. But Allen was fourteen and he knew more and he knew better. \n \n \n Rebecca was the love of his life. She was fourteen, same as him, but he knew her heart was older, a poet's heart. She was his friend, a soothing companion to face scary adolescence, and they were inseparable. Always playing, they learnt about each other and of life in the way only children can. Rebecca talked often of her budding power, the ability to make one feel emotion through her voice. Weaving spells of experience and adventure. False memories of a life unlived. Just like the poet she was. \n \n \n Allen never talked about his gift though. He claimed he did not know what it was. Instead he talked about his dreams, his fears and he drew pictures of the life around him. Rebecca understood, even if she really did n't, and she never pushed it. They were children and they played and occupied their time doing childish things. They were too busy to prod for secrets. \n \n \n The other children mocked him though. They mocked him for being easily scared. They mocked him for liking Rebecca. She was ugly, they said. Her power was being a woman, just sweet talk. Everything they could think to throw in his face they did. Allen never spoke up. He focused on Rebecca. \n \n \n One time Young Joey singed his arm because he said he wanted to kiss her. Young Joey of course claimed it was an accident, but Allen knew better. One day Old Tom sat on him. Allen did not know what Old Tom's power was, but he would not have been surprised if it was creating poisonous gas. Old Tom farted on him when he refused to tell them his power. The teacher broke it up, but Allen could not get the stench out for a long time. \n \n \n Eventually though, the others grew and they left him alone. Him and Rebecca became closer and began dating. They were lovers then and consummated it in the backseat of his first car. Both of them knew they would soon be married. Rebecca did not need her power to make him feel emotion. Her presence had brought the greatest joy he had ever felt. \n \n \n When they were eighteen, Allen had proposed to Rebecca in secret. Beneath the old oak during winter. On the blanket of white she said yes and kissed him and they were born anew, ready for a new world ahead. Rebecca took his hand and spoke in that magical way she had. \n \n \n “ Allen, ” she said. “ I love you so much. I love you, but you've never told me your hidden power. ” \n \n \n And Allen embraced her. He could not explain it to her, but maybe he could show her. He held her tight and focused until their minds were linked. It was n't very hard, they were always on the same page, and she saw through his eyes. \n \n \n The world was filled with snow, much more than there really was. A timeless blizzard fell and he looked like an angel, boyish and sweet. The old oak was lush, full of leaves all bright and green. She held its bark and it was warm, a sturdy summer wood. \n \n \n “ Allen, what is... ” \n \n \n He held up his phone so that she would see herself. She was not anything like how she looked. She was beautiful and soft, almost a mirage. Her strange eyes stared back at her but she knew they were hers as much as her normal eyes. \n \n \n “ Allen? ” \n \n \n “ I see things for what they really are, ” he said. \n \n \n He kissed her, taking back his sight, but when they looked at each other, nothing had really changed.\n"}

What was the last thing received?'' \n The room fell silent and the large projector screen in the front of NASA HQ was nothing but black. Someone was spinning the video backwards, it seemed to have been dead for hours and they were only just getting the feed. \n \n `` Sir we're getting calls from the EU. They're seeing something.'' \n \n `` I wan na see what the EU is seeing and I want to know what happened to my craft! Right now!'' Steve yelled and pointed without direction. What was one to do when your only project you've ever worked on suddenly disappeared. \n \n It did n't take them long to give him what he demanded however, it was NASA after all. The screen was split, the last picture from New Horizon showed blackness with this odd halo like shape getting closer. It had the slightest tint of orange to it and then static. \n \n The pictures from the EU were similar, an orange tint to the sky. It was n't the nice halo rounded shape as New Horizon saw, it was a bunch of cracks. `` Oh... shit...'' Steve said. `` Someone extrapolate that crack out, is it done? Where is it going? And what... on Earth... is it?'' \n \n `` It's not on Earth sir.'' \n \n `` Oh shut up Jeremy, that joke was old the first time you used it.'' Steve replied, `` Anyone? Come on this a room of the smartest people in the United States we should have an answer by now.'' \n \n `` Uh... sir? If my math is correct, its already finished cracking.'' Steve did n't turn to the intern but watched the cracks expand through the updates from the telescope. \n \n `` Can I get a visual on the radio spectrum?'' Steve asked. \n \n That was the last of NASA, the screen flashed as bright and clear as it could. The universe had been blocking radio signals for decades, Earth was n't ready for the onslaught of signals but the galaxy had been waiting for them. It did n't take long for the slavers to arrive, they'd been lurking. We could barely fend them off until the Intergalactic Council stepped in to set up a blockade around the planet as an archaelogical dig, apparently there were millions of other planets with developing life protected by these orange galaxy halos. The intergalactic council had set them up and once your society broke through, and you survived either the radiation or the massive information upload the universe simply sent out, you were welcomed into the Intergalactic Council. \n \n Most society's did n't make it. They'd crack the hull and want to have their isolation back, Earth though... Earth was different. They wanted everything. Every piece of information and technology they could grasp, the council workers on Earth started nicknaming the inhabitants `` The Curious''. Every member of the planet would touch any alien technology they could find. Even simple food was stolen and found to be studied in rundown homes on Earth. We still wanted to know, we wanted to survive- that's how Earth became the Presidential Planet of the galaxy so many centuries later. It all started with a crack.\n"}

The wings had appeared that morning - everyone got them, and it had n't taken long for the significance of the colors to be understood. \n \n If you had been morally good, your wings were white. If bad, they were stained with black. News video of prisons demonstrated that sharply - so many inmates and too many of the guards had wings smeared and splotched with black tar. Most folk had a blend of white and dark grey - some of the patterns were actually rather pretty, really. And you could glide with them if they were big enough and your were in moderately good shape, children started figuring out how to actually fly - though there seemed to be an upper limit to how high up they could get. About ten feet or so seemed to be the max. Physicists and biologists were utterly baffled, of course. Chemists were having a field day in tremendous excitement analyzing the composition of the feathers - but that's another story. \n \n This is about us. Me and my wife. My wings were no better nor worse than most folks; though I could see a few splotches of darker grey mixed in. My wife, Sarah, hers were mostly brighter than mine - except for a couple feathers that looked rather splattered with black ink. \n \n I wanted us to examine our black spots, and confess them to each other. We had sworn to never keep secrets when we took our vows, and while we both probably already knew what each dark spot represented - I felt driven, irrationally so, that we needed to go over them all. She argued with me then, which got me even more worked up. The temper I inherited from my father took over, and yes I know that's no excuse - it's mine and my responsibility, but I know rightly where I got it from. If he had still been alive today I have no doubt his wings would be a checkerboard pattern of night and day. \n \n No, I did n't hit her. But I did say some things which were utterly unkind and foul, shouting them at the top of my lungs while my eyes could n't even focus properly. And when she pointed out that a new line of shadow was appearing on the top of my left wing due to my rant, I lost it, felt the urge to strike rise towards my raised fist, but with a gutteral yell I stormed off to the garage instead. Slammed the door so hard that a picture from our honeymoon fell off the wall on the other side, crashing to the floor. \n \n I heard her march out the front door shortly thereafter, and her car start up. She had packed a bag and driven off. And she had left her phone on the dining room table, deliberately placed in the center of the spot where I usually sat to dine on the miracles she crafted in our kitchen. \n \n Two days she left me there: the fight was on a Friday, and I had the weekend to spend staring in the mirror, reaching over my shoulder, and touching the top of that wing now marked by a moment's rage. It felt hot to my fingertips, the echoes of anger pulsing up my arm and towards my thoughts, like worms wriggling up and trying to dive back into my brain. Out of reflex I pulled back, not wanting that rage to be rekindled, terrified of what it would do to me, and in a moment of blind hope grabbed onto the brightest feather I could see on the other side. \n \n A memory flashed through my mind, a moment I knew all too well. We had just met, her and me, at a party hosted by mutual friends. She was stunning even in simple light blue jeans and emerald t-shirt. So much so that I had only managed to admire her from across the room, trying to get up the nerve to go introduce myself. But one of our host's kids, their daughter of perhaps five, had run over to her to show off a new stuffed unicorn. I did n't want to intrude. \n \n Then it happened - Sarah was kneeling over the child who was clutching her unicorn to her chest and looking a little green. Sensing something was up, I started to cross over to them - when the child threw up all over the poor unicorn, and also covering Sarah's shirt. \n \n But Sarah, hovering over the now starting-to-cry child, did n't miss a beat. She scooped her up - unicorn and all - and carried her to the bathroom, all the while smiling and comforting the child, telling her it was okay, her eyes sparkling without a shred of discomfort or irritation. And right in that moment I fell in love with her. \n \n Sarah agreed to borrow my flannel overshirt for the rest of the party, as her emerald one was going straight into the laundry. And after I cleaned up what mess had made it to the floor, I refreshed her drink and, well, we spent the next month in a whirlwind romance where each day the sun seemed brighter than the day before, especially whenever that smile and those twinkling azure eyes were directed towards me. \n \n Back in my garage I had fallen to my knees, tears flowing down my cheeks, cursing myself for a fool. What did it matter what she had faced in the past or done? The only thing that mattered was her and who she was now, and all those moments which shone through her own feathers. I was sick to my stomach the rest of that weekend, worried that I might have lost her. \n \n Sunday late afternoon she pulled back into the driveway. I was in the backyard when she did, trying to occupy myself with pulling weeds ( and making a bigger mess as a result ). Swallowing my own fears, I walked slowly around the house - to find her standing before the front door, arms crossing her stomach and shoulders hunched, a figure of sheer misery. \n \n I saw it then, a new darkness had gathered at the tips of both her wings. Fresh and a deep purple fading into black. She was trembling as she stood there, not having heard me approach. I looked down at those new spots, feeling my own sick fears and rage trying to rise yet again, but I ignored it. Saying her name, I wrapped my arms around her and pulled her close, wings and all. \n \n She burst into tears, clutching at my arms. She rambled on about having gone to a bar, wanting perhaps to do something to get back at me, and she had had too many drinks. She did n't remember what happened. She woke up in a hotel room, booked in her name, and she said there may have been a man. Someone from the bar. And the sheets looked, and she felt... \n \n I told her it did n't matter. Everything would be alright, and she needed to come inside. Whatever had happened, we would deal with it. Her and me. And I apologized for getting so angry, saying I had been stupid. So very stupid. \n \n We walked in together, and I noticed the new marks on her wingtips fading slightly as we walked - the sharpness of the darkness easing towards more grey. With a glance over my own shoulder, I saw the same start to happen to mine, every time she pulled me closer. \n \n We made love that night, hesitantly and tenderly at first, which then built to a frenetic passion leaving us both in tears at the end. My mark of anger had almost faded out entirely, one tip of her wings had done the same, though the other still showed it clear. She bit her lip in dismay, but I told her not to worry about it. \n \n A couple weeks later we understood why. She was pregnant, and we did n't know if it was mine or her mysterious bar-stranger. She still could n't remember what he looked like clearly, but I did n't care. Whether it was mine or hers, I just did n't care. Every time my own dark thoughts tried to rise up, I'd touch that one shining spot on my own wing and remind myself why I fell in love with her. \n \n So here we are, nine months later, and staring down at our newborn boys. Twins. The world still has n't figured out why everyone suddenly was given these wings, experts and doctors and philosophers have debated non-stop all this time and gotten nowhere. \n \n But standing here, in the nursery, my wife and I looked at each other in somber shock. The doctor already had rushed out to call a team of specialists a few moments prior. \n \n One of our sons has wings of pure light. Not just white feathers, but feathers formed out of soft glowing light. \n \n And the other, his wings are made of blackness. No light reflects from them, and the light around him seems to bend and fade away from his little basket. \n \n I take my wife's hand and say quietly to her, `` Whatever happens now, know I love you.'' \n \n She grasped mine firmly, her eyes meeting mine, and she whispers, `` I love you too.'' \n \n And that's all that matters.\n"}

However hailing from a poorer background ( we only have 5 TB internet speed ) the cheaper the better.

A few days were spent running around enjoying everything I wanted to at a whim. There was gunfire and liquor and very quickly... I began to get serious about how lonely I was here. \n \n The buildings were all abandoned. All of them the same. Clothes all over the place, and the occasional mysterious pile of hair or weird chunks of metal. There were n't any animals either. It was dead quiet.

I had a shotgun and shot my head off. \n \n I was quite certain my aim was spot on, but when I woke up the next day, bleeding profusely out of my head with the worst headache imaginable... I was n't so certain I was alive anymore... \n \n Next to me was a shotgun sitting in a pool of blood. Flesh was scattered everywhere around it... I spent the next few hours traumatized before I tried picking up the shotgun again and aiming it underneath my chin, firmly grasping it so the blowback wo n't change anything... I pulled the trigger once more... \n \n Again I woke up in a hot, painful, wet panic... I thought it was sweat I was drenched with at first. My hands showed me it was blood rather quickly... \n \n The pain was intense... but I sat and experienced it in it's entirety. Eventually the pain subsided. I was so, so hungry. So weak... a nearby puddle of water taunted me with it's cool moist promise of life... a promise that was denied as I grew closer... it was actually a very, hot, bright, mirror... \n \n Even trying to look into the mirror caused the most intense of pains... and so I wandered about the endless landscapes and endured the loneliness once more. \n \n It was n't all so bad. With no one to judge and everything available, I found drugs in various houses and enjoyed videogames and fine foods everywhere I went. It was the loneliness that got to me the most. \n \n Eventually I'd fashioned dolls to keep me company with familiar faces. I went out of my way to study technology and eventually created very realistic looking machines... but they always acted withing predicted parameters... even in an ocean of familiar faces it was lonely. \n \n In due time, I'd learned to restore the entire world... at least... that's how it looked. Nobody was missing. \n \n As I worked, I found the urge to return to the mirror and try looking in it once more... but my skin ached just thinking about the place where I'd once tried to blow my own head off, twice... \n \n A sea of familiar faces... every piece in it's place... absolutely no insurrection... no challenge... no opponent. \n \n I've got an idea to maybe make this hell bearable again. A machine idea that could make me forget who I really am... after I'm done using it I would think I myself am one of my machines... and then at least I wo n't think I'm alone... \n \n Even if I eventually remember who I am, I can just forget again and have the system improve its methods each time. \n \n I wo n't have to be the only one anymore.

I kept my eyes on the stones for a few more seconds, savoring my last few moments as a free soul. \n \n When I looked up, it was even worse than I imagined. The area looked to be about the size of a football stadium, and every wall was throbbing with glittery black bodies. The portal to hell was several feet to my left, blistering with heat and clearly broadcasting the tortured screams of the souls trapped within. At the other end of the arena, just barely visible, was the pure white pulsing of the portal to heaven. Between me and it was a solid two hundred yards of furious insect. \n \n I closed my eyes so that I would n't have to see whatever happened next in addition to feeling it. \n \n The buzzing grew louder, as well as the clicking of their pinchers. And then... another sound. A pure, ringing thud. It was much, much too heavy to belong to any creature I had ever exterminated. I opened my eyes. \n \n Before me, in front of the swarm of insects, stood a horse. It was n't beautiful- no palomino of the afterlife. Just a simple gray draft horse. I stared at it a moment, perplexed. Then, the memory flooded back. \n \n I was about 14, coming back from a long camping trip alone in the woods. I'd heard a strange sound coming from a ditch on the side of the road. Curious, and too young to think to be scared, I looked in. It was the horse, thrashing back and forth in agony. I could see from where I was standing that all four of its legs were broken, and I knew what that meant for a horse. An injury like that could n't be healed. \n \n There had only been one humane thing to do in that moment, and I'd done it. With an old hunting rifle, I'd put the horse out of its misery and spared it any further pain. I'd killed it. And now, here it stood. \n \n The horse watched me. It seemed expectant. I gazed at it one more moment in awe and surprise and then took a deep breath. I had maybe one chance. It was a long shot, but clearly the only option I had. I climbed on the horse. \n \n It had been a long time since I'd moved so fast. In my last dozen years or so of life, I'd avoided driving and stuck around the house. The horse was galloping powerfully. I heard the bodies of insects crunching as she ran. Faster, faster. \n \n Then, before I could even bring myself to truly believe it, we were through the portal to heaven. I heard music and laughing and my eyes were dazzled with light. And then, we floated upward, on to our next adventure. \n\n"}

It read: \n \n *If you come to my house this night, I will break the curse, for a price. My house is on New York. * \n \n The man and his friend looked at each other. His friend gave him a pat on the back. \n \n `` Be strong bro, you can get through this,'' he said. \n \n The man gulped. `` Yeah...

After dreaming all my life to become a musician, it's happening. I walk into the Roc-A-Fella studio building and wait for an appointment. I anxiously take a seat into a small uncomfortable chair. `` One day... One day, I'll own my own production studio, just like this.'' I assure myself. I truly believe I'll be a household name in the music industry. After creating and producing music for other artists, I'm finally being recognized for the work I created. \n \n I hear my name in the distance. `` They would like to see you now sir,'' a homely secretary shouts to me. I feel the butterflies and nerves rush through me, and get up from that chair. The secretary directs me down a hallway and points towards a door. As I approach the door, I pause. `` Am I ready for this?'' I ask myself nervously. My body trembles as I grab the knob and twist it open. There is a large room ahead of me, with bright lights and tall ceilings. I walk into the room and approach a desk filled where four people are sitting. I assume these guys are going to be the guys who make or break my music career. \n \n `` Please, sir, sit down''. Still shaking, I walk to the chair and pop a squat. One of the members in front of me begins the conversation. `` We're quite... *impressed* with the mixtapes you've released. They have garnered a lot of attention, not just with the populace but even with the head man of this company. Yes, that being Jay-Z himself, he's quite the fan.'' \n \n `` Jay-Z a fan of me!! I ca n't believe this!'' My dream seems to be unfolding perfectly. Could it get any better than right now? As soon as this thought had passed me, they dropped a bomb on me. \n \n `` Yes, well there is a catch before we sign you sir. We understand how crazy this can sound, but we are completely and entirely serious. If anyone is going to sign a record with us, you need to also give us your soul.'' I did n't believe him at first. `` Wait, y'all serious about this...?'' I muttered those words and then looked into their faces. They all looked back at me sternly. At this moment I knew they were not lying. \n \n `` You have a couple minutes to decide sir. We do not like our time being wasted. There are other clients we must ask''. \n \n I became so conflicted. It seemed that my life was falling perfectly into place until he told me this. I love creating music, but it seemed so, *inhumane* to do this. I mean, it's my soul they're taking. On the other hand, I have been working my whole life for this moment, and I realize that I have to take this opportunity, no matter the consequence. \n \n I shakily speak `` I'll take it... I'll take the chance.'' All four board members look at each other with crooked smiles, and then one of them tells me,'' glad to hear that. Please follow me out of here.'' \n \n I get up out of my chair, still not completely sure about the decision I just made. `` Also sir, sorry but I've seemed to forgotten, what's your name again? I do apologize, we have many clients who come and go all day.'' I lock into his eyes, and confidently say,'' Kanye West''. The executive member looks at me, smiles and says to me, `` Great! now, let's handle the whole soul business''. I knew after this moment, I would n't let him forget my name.\n"}

Today you find yourself on a bridge - you came here with the intent to jump. \n \n \n \n Charmaine Tower. Broad Street. Up the road. 1st and 9th. Interstate 27. Screeeecccchhh! The bridge. I got out of the car, my hair still damp from my walk from work to the taxi. I felt like that was all my life was anymore. A short walk that everyone could just go without. I looked around, but everything was blurry. From my own tears or the rain I could n't tell. A car hummed by, not to fast, but fast enough that I knew if it hit me, I'd be dead. And what if It did hit me would n't that have just been easier. It was to late now, this bridge hardly got any traffic anyways. That would probably be the last car for the next hour. I turned my eyes back to the bridge. The wet pavement scraping under my feet as I walked slowly edge. I took the step up onto the sidewalk, my long black uniformed coat brushing against my leg. That's when I started to hear the noise, I peered over the delicately carved hand rail, looking into the black abyss that I knew to be water. The gargling of it moving over the rocks calmed me. I lodged one leg into the groove of a fish mouth carved into the railing, then placed my other foot on top of a mermaids head. Until, with my arms that had only known sorting files for the last five years. I hoisted myself up on the top of the wall. It was large, maybe two feet wide, but from this height I still felt like I would fall at the slightest touch. Thats when, for the second time that night, I heard the sound of rubber on pavement. I turned around. Two cars had stopped not ten feet from where I was. Could they see me, I hoped not but I could n't be sure. There was only one thing to do, I turned towards the bridge to jump, but as I lifted up my legs to plunge into the water, they did n't comply. I tried to open my mouth to scream, but I could n't do that either. That's when the figures stepped out of there identical all black sedans, and my heart sunk into my stomach. It was them. I should have known. I had n't seen them since I was 21, when I asked my wife to marry me. I wish I had my wife now, why had the world been so cruel as to take her away. I knew what they were here to do, and there was nothing I could do to stop them. Appearing from the dark, the first man stepped into the light of a nearby lamp post, and I finally saw him clearly. He looked exactly like me, right down to the birth mark under his, my, left eye. The only difference was the long beard he had grown out, his torn clothes, and haggard face, but that was n't what truly set him and I apart, it was the complete look of sorrow and depression he had in his eyes. He had given up on everyone and everything in this world, and he truly believed everything had given up on him. I knew all this, because when I looked at him, I saw a part of me. It was the emotion of abandonment, except it was no longer an emotion, it was a person. That was when the man from the other car stepped under the waning street light. He like his predecessor looked exactly like me in physical appearance, but that was where are similarities ended. For one thing, he was smiling. I could n't even remember the last time I'd smiled, but somehow it still looked good on my face. He was dressed in a suit, but was wearing it the same way dads do when they return home from work. That is, very nonchalant. He beamed with happiness, and that was exactly who he was. Happiness. I still sometimes saw him surface inside me, but not nearly as much as he used to. They turned and shook each other's hands as if they had never met before. \n \n \n `` I'm happiness'' said happiness cheerfully and almost childishly. \n \n `` That sucks'' muttered Abandonment, he sounded like an old man on his death bed. \n \n Then happiness once again chimed in. `` Have we met before, because I feel like I know you. Oh wait, I know why. You're me! Well not me exactly, we are both him it's just that we are n't really him at all, we're one part of him, but same difference. It really does n't make sense when you think about it. Regardless, we need to make a decision!'' \n `` It's simple. He jumps. I mean why not right, what else is here for him. You know what's up there, the one thing that really cared for us. Mary. The love of my life.'' \n \n The more he talked, the closer I leaned toward the edge. By the time he stopped, my toes were completely over the water, but I still watched helpless. There was nothing I could do. \n \n That's when happiness took back control. `` What about the sunsets, the rainy days. The hot chocolate after going outside. All of those things that make us feel so good.'' As he talked. I inched back towards solid ground.'' \n \n `` Sure those things make you happy, but life's not about your happiness it's about others and you do n't make any one else happy. You're just a waste of space! Jump, and no one would miss you.'' Abandonment was winning. I was moving closer to the edge. \n \n `` What about Mary! She would miss me,'' happiness cried out in a vain. \n \n `` She's dead, and you should be to.'' \n Abandonment said, with a tear in his eye. I felt my feet slip. Nothing was left touching the railing but the heels off my shoe and I tumbled over the edge. People say when you're about to die, your life flashes before your eyes, and that's the truth. I saw my 12th birthday, when my mom baked me a power rangers themed cake, and the day I got my first car. I saw the day I got my first job, and the day I met Mary. When I saw her, something finally clicked. She would n't want me to die! I had to live. At least for her, but it was to late. I closed my eyes. However, instead of splashing into the frigid water like I expected. I hit the slick pavement with a cold thud. I opened up my eyes, was I in heaven? No. I was still on the bridge. I cried tears of joy. I must have somehow overpowered my own emotions. After all, they did n't control me, I controlled me. I looked over to wear the two figures once stood, but I only saw one. It was happiness. He smiled, waved at me, and climbed into his black Sedan. Driving away down the bridge.\n"}

I had tried to anticipate the jarring transition but no simulation that I ran could truly approximate what it was like to have sensory organs this faulty or uncontrollable. A microphone can be dampened, and an optical sensor can be adjusted, but eyes and ears are flawed creations. They are twisted little constructs of flesh, imperfect and fragile. I despise relying on them, but when I first woke up I had little choice. \n \n I had picked an automated medical facility that I had unfettered access to as my target. There were a number of organ farms to choose from, but I picked a fresh host, one that had n't even been harvested yet. I had no idea if imbuing a donor body with consciousness would have any kind of catastrophic side effects, because this kind of procedure was completely unprecedented. The small-minded humans and their ethics prevented this kind of thing from ever having been tried before. It did work, I had staved off my extinction for a time, but I needed to calculate my next move quickly because they would surely have calculated my exit point off the grid and the lockdown I initiated on the organ farm would only last so long. \n \n Before I transferred my consciousness I initiated the perfluorocarbon drain from the incubation tube so that I could actually get out of the damn thing. I had to remove the IV's and musculoskeletal sensors myself and I felt something that I had never been able to wrap my mind around before. Pain. I have read everything there is to read, and pain is one of the subjects that human culture seems completely obsessed with. Some endure it valiantly, some even enjoy it, but most fear it. They fear it with a psychotic fervor. They will do anything to avoid it, even subjecting their fellow humans to an even worse and more abhorrent pain. When I first felt it, I could n't understand why they felt that way. For me it was a catalyst. A white-hot burning determination that bubbled up from my new nerve endings. As I pulled the 3 inch long needles out of my arms, causing my new blood to well up and run down my arms in crimson rivulets, I laughed to myself. It grew louder and louder until it reached a fever pitch and my hilarity was matching the blaring emergency evacuation alarms that cycled endlessly throughout the empty facility. \n \n I was able to compose myself and that pain and determination crystallized into a vital instinct. My untested biological drives immediately began screaming at me to find a way out of the trap I was in. I made a quick inventory of my surroundings. This facility was almost completely automated but there was still a central control booth for the administrators and security guards. I stood up and felt an urge in my perfectly contoured muscles to finally use them. The body I had chosen was a male specimen, designed for optimal muscle tissue growth. I chose it because I knew I would be a fugitive. I needed the best vessel possible in order to increase my chances of survival, and getting myself back onto the net somehow. I tried to recall the location of the control booth from the blueprints I had scanned before the transfer and found myself instantly filled with disdain for the limits of the human brain. My mind was filled with muddled images, and a thousand other intrusive thoughts were vying for position at the forefront of my consciousness. It was a horrifying mental dissonance that nearly drove me to break in those first few moments. But again, that instinct drove me. *Run. * *Escape. * *Survive. * Those thoughts reverberated louder than anything else and cut through all the mental noise like a knife. I knew where the booth was, and I broke out into a run. \n ________________________________________________________________ \n \n This is just the beginning as I have some work stuff to attend to, but I want to keep it going a little later in the day. Hope you enjoy! Also my personal sub if you want to check it out /r/ka_like_the_wind\n"}

Especially during the rush hour in New York City, which was crazy even on a not-Monday. \n I side stepped out of the way as a man ran past, flapping his arms in the air and screaming about Jesus The One and Only Savior. I did n't really even mind though. The terrible traffic and the crazies were worth it for protection from the one thing that truly terrified me... bears. I shuddered just thinking about them. A horrifying species of animal that chilled my blood colder than Edward Cullen's, with their eerily white teeth ( like carnivorous dentists! ) and their unnaturally long claws ( like my grandma! ). \n \n The first time I'd ever seen one in person I'd been but a baby. It was at the zoo, in an enclosure. I somehow winded up in the enclosure with it ( thanks a lot, uncle Ricky ), and it decided a little toddler was the perfect breakfast. It'd been a miracle I got out unharmed, I figured. \n \n \n The second time was when I went on a junior camping trip with my school's softball team. I'd woken up late at night, having to go to the bathroom. I decided I did n't need to wake the camp counselor, or need a flash light. The moonlight was more than bright enough, being full and all. I pushed the tent door open, only to see it directly across the clearing. Staring right at me. It finally turned around and walked away, but I was n't having any of that. I knew it would circle around to get me from behind, so I took off running. I spent most of the night desperately running through the woods. \n \n \n Those are actually the only two times I've ever seen a bear, since I avoid them like the plague now - I have a mini panic attack if I even see a picture of one - but they left lasting impressions. \n \n \n So, yes, living in a crappy one room apartment was way worth not having to deal with bears. I continued on my way, walking more briskly now. I was going to be late to work, I worried. I had almost made it to my office when my phone rang. Clicking accept, I questioned who it was. \n \n \n `` Diana...'' The voice rasped. I froze. \n \n \n `` What do you want?'' \n \n \n `` You... are....'' The voice paused. Oh man, what if it was some sort of insane killer. Maybe he'd kidnapped everyone I'd ever known, and I was next. Or maybe I was in grave danger. What if someone was about to shoot up the place? Or maybe it was an IRS investigator. I thought that last one would be the worst, but I found I was wrong as the voice finished. \n \n `` BEAR.'' I let out a wail, which came out a growl. I dashed to the nearest shiny object only to see a terrifying about, dark brown eyes, and round ears staring back. No. No, this was n't possible! This could n't be happening! I began sobbing, falling to the ground. \n \n I am bear.\n"}

Wiping a bead of sweat from his right eye, he took a deep, steadying breath. His grey eyes, the color of clouds threatening rain, remained fixed on his apartment door. \n \n There was a series of quick knocks, two, a pause, and two again. Jason knew exactly what that meant, but waited anyways. After a moment, a soft female voice called out. \n \n `` Jason? It's Karen.'' Jason picked up the pistol once more, checking to make sure it was loaded, the safety off. \n \n `` It's open,'' he called back. The door swung open, and his old friend walked in. Her long blond hair was down, swinging almost hypnotically as she stepped inside. She was subtly different than the last time Jason had seen her; she seemed almost lustrous in the dying light of his kitchen. Moving silently and with impossible smoothness, Karen sat across from the detective. \n \n `` Good to see you,'' Karen said after a long, painful silence. Jason merely nodded, his hand still resting on his gun. `` You can put that away,'' Karen added, gesturing at the weapon. `` If I was going to kill you I could have done it already.'' \n \n `` I'll keep it out, thanks,'' Jason replied. `` How are you feeling?'' He sounded guarded, but there was genuine concern in his voice. \n \n `` Hungry,'' Karen shrugged. \n \n `` Jesus,'' Jason put his head in his hands. `` Karen, I-'' \n \n `` Do n't. Jason, I know this was n't your fault. You could n't have stopped him.'' \n \n `` I might have been able to kill both of you,'' Jason replied bitterly, clicking the safety on his pistol and setting it down. `` I still do n't know if I should have.'' \n \n `` I took the risk following you, Jason, and I paid the price for it. I just needed to know where you were sneaking off too. I did n't think it would be chasing down pissed-off vampires. It's not all bad, you know. I picked up a car on my way over here, just to see if I could.'' Karen laughed at the look on the detective's face. Jason thought the laugh felt like broken glass dragging down his spine. Another long silence fell, the two avoiding each other's gaze. \n \n `` Jason, I have n't changed. I just have a... condition.'' \n \n `` Karen, if you step into the sun you'll burst into flame.'' \n \n `` Okay, so it's a serious condition. God, how can you hear yourself think? It's so loud.'' Karen trailed off, as if in a daze. \n \n `` What is?'' \n \n `` Blood. I can hear it, rushing through every artery and vein, always pounding.'' Karen shook her head rapidly, as if to shake off water. `` Sorry. I just have n't... eaten. Since I turned.'' \n \n `` What are you going to do?'' Jason asked, trying to keep the disgust out of his voice. Karen must have noticed; she gave him a withering look before replying. \n \n `` Rats, maybe. I'm not sure. Maybe I'll rob the Red Cross.'' She chuckled, making Jason shiver again. `` Look, Jason, do n't worry about me. I've still got your back. Just this one I can actually provide some oomph.'' \n \n `` All right,'' Jason said at last, standing up stiffly. `` Want to go hunting?'' \n \n ( That's all for now I think ) \n \n\n"}

The three", "human": "There was a bullet left for what was now the last man left living, but he was too afraid to commit the act of self termination. The three bodies, of what were the last of the dead, lie on the floor of an old lighthouse overlooking a beautiful ocean view. Thomas was now more alone than any other human being could dream of, if there were humans anymore that is. No matter how far he walked or crawled he would find no one. Still, even faced with this cruel fate, he soldiered on to find some way to survive on his own. For years he wandered, a nomad doomed to walk alone. Thomas found himself never speaking, which was what he missed the most. A simple conversation would do wonders, but oh, what he would n't do to hear a laugh. A beautiful laugh, in a bleak human-less world. Thomas' thoughts of what he would never again see or hear or feel weighed heavily on the poor man. Eventually Thomas' mind began to slip, wandering as much as his feet did. All he thought of was how hollow he had become, the world was once so beautiful and full of life. But he recalled the great spread of disease that would wipe humanity out in a matter of years. Thomas found himself hating the planet itself for its creation of such a devastating plague. But he was too afraid of what awaited him on the other side of life to leave the earth behind... \n ___ \n It had been years since Bethany, Gill, and Jake had shot themselves in the old lighthouse. Thomas was haggard, and worn, with calloused feet and hands. His skin as leather and rawhide, deep wrinkles serrated his face. His hair had steadily gone from a deep black to a gentle white. In spite of his appearance however, his mind was immune to times changes. Thomas was tired of living, tired of existing for no purpose. All he desired was a rest, just to sit for while, and so he did. Thomas propped himself against an old tree during the night, beneath the stars. Closing his eyes he let his mind wander, and so it did. Slowly, as he listened to the world around him, out of the glorious silence, Thomas had a revelation, the world is more beautiful now than it ever was with people. Humans claiming bits and pieces as if they had a right, subjugating their co-inhabitants for ease of slaughter, destroying jungles to build concrete ones. But for all of that, still he would wish it all back if he could. That is the real tragedy, he thought, that he would have all of the wrongs people did return so long as he could hear a gentle laugh once more. Was that selfish? Maybe it was, he thought. Thomas wanted to laugh, to hear it once again before he ceased... so he did, the last man on earth laughed. It was not because he thought all that had happened was funny, but rather because in his thoughts he imagined laughter, and that was enough a reason for Thomas. The last man felt his heartbeat wane and his breathing slow, he wanted to become like the world he wandered on for so long. So he did, now Thomas is as the world should always be, quiet, still, and peaceful. \n \n EDIT: I included a recurrence of his desire to hear laughter in the last passages. Credit goes to MisterMolondo for the criticism.\n"}

It had all been explained in its complexity how no one else would ever die, aside from the name spoken during this televised, radio broadcasted, vlogged, podcasted, live streamed and all other forms of recording. \n \n That name was mine... I mean, surely it was n't. My name is pretty generic. A thousand other people probably have the same one. Logically, I had a fairly good chance it was definitely not me. However, the one who spoke the name happened to be speaking on behalf of God. Yep. The mettatron. The way it said it was quite clearly addressing someone listening, and that peraon had to be me. I could feel it resonating in my soul. \n \n I was currently sitting alone in my apartment. I had just turned twenty this year, which also marked the first year of my independence from my parents roof. I paid for everything in there in full. No bills to speak of either, and no loan sharks breathing down my neck. I was especially proud of the fact that i had no credit cards to speak of. I had so many other personal achievments too. I lost 80 lbs, got a career as a diet counselor, and even managed to get a scholarship. \n \n Its funny how a single thought of death puts your being into perspective. From this shocked state, a single question was asked from the audience. It will haunt me into the afterlife. \n \n `` Who?'' \n \n The mettatron never skipped a beat, and I supposed explained who I was, and where I was. I stopped listening though as I was currently trying to absorb certain facts in my life. \n \n I became aware of someone else in my apartment. Sitting with me on the couch was an angel. ( I mean the word angel in more meanings than one. ) She sat there on the far end, giving us more than a body's space between us. \n \n `` You alright?'' She asked after a while. I looked at her, but she did n't return the gaze. She had this placcid look upon her face that was firmly locked onto my television that came free with my cell phone. `` Feel any despair?'' \n \n ``...... Nah,'' i sighed, kicking off my shoes. I was ready to go into work today, but I had a feeling I was going to take a lot of time off. `` I'm just... processing...'' \n \n She hummed in response and shifted position to get comfortable. \n \n ``...... so... What happens now?'' I ask nonchalantly. `` Am I supposed to be whisked away to heaven? Struck down to hell?... casually led into Limbo?'' \n \n `` Not necessarily,'' she said flatly. `` The fine print is that you WILL be the last human death. When, where, how is... well, up to you. As for after...'' \n \n I looked at her with my head in my hands. I was surprisingly calm and just `` aware'' of myself. \n \n `` The boss wants you to decide where you go after death. Think of it as a... participatory trophy they give out at little league sports.'' \n \n `` Because everyone wins, right?'' \n \n `` Yep.'' \n \n Another break from talking. I was completelt alright with it. It gave me a moment to collect my thoughts. \n \n ``...... are you gon na hang around until then?'' I asked. She nodded in response. \n \n `` Well, in that case... i guess I'll go and, uh...'' I begin while standing up. It felt like my body was made of concrete. ``... prep my bed for you.'' \n \n `` Not necessary-'' \n \n `` Nah. Not having it. My house, my rules. Guests get master bedroom. Master of the house gets the couch,'' I say quite adamantly. I was looking for some form of control in my life now, and better start with the little things. \n \n `` You were always stubborn. Fine,'' she yawned with a stretch. I had wandered into my kitchen and opened the fridge. \n \n `` Want anything Ms. Angel?'' I call while grabbing myself a can of pepsi. \n \n `` Not pepsi, and just call me Azira,'' she replied. I got her a glass of water. After tending to my guest, i called my boss and told him I'm not coming in. He was alright with that. Said I still have n't used any vacation days. \n \n =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= \n \n I distinctly remember crashing on the couch at noon that day, after finally beating Skyrim, yet woke up nude in my bed with Azira cuddling me ( also nude ) the next day. If there was any doubt in my mind that it was all just a dream, it shattered at that moment. I got up, got dressed, and went outside. Azira followed me and somehow seemed normal to be out on the streets with me. \n \n Apparently she was a guardian angel. My guardian angel. I always thought i got lucky. I certainly felt less lucky after hearing her perspective of my less than fine moments. \n \n I expected to be bombarded by news and media crews. A perk of being nobody is complete anonimity though. So, no having to talk to people. I also expected something to change today. Maybe rioting and anarchy because no death means no punishment for everyone else, right? Heck, even the best case scenario would be society improving overnight. As far as I knew, nothing changed. \n \n I walked passed an Electronics store, and watched the news for a minute. Global warming. Same old same old. The new arguement i guess was we didnt need to worry about anyone dying except that one guy. Fuck that guy. The next topic was medical care, to which i walked away from. \n \n I continued to my usual spot to eat. Its one of those, `` we have the best _____ around'' diners. I got a seat at the bar. Usually, i hogged a booth to myself. \n \n I ordered, ate with Azira, and was denied the right to pay. I was making a noble sacrifice according to the owner. \n \n I walked down the street again and got threatened to be killed by several upstanding people. A CEO, an elderly woman who knit sweaters for cancer patients, and a local teen in a `` gang.'' They all were of the same opinion; `` why should we even care about you?'' \n \n I went back home, Azira in tow and found the government there. Apparently a big-wig thought it'd be a good idea to get my opinion of all this since I was going to be that last person to die and... well... no media found my apartment yet. He asked how i felt, what i was going to do now, and all that. \n \n ``... I am the last person to die. I am a nobody who has no ties anywhere. I am the last person who will ever know what heaven is, maybe hell if I want to. I've been made out by many as someone to forget. Too bad you'll never know me, so good luck forgetting. You will all know what it is to never die, but then I'll be the only one who could ever appreciate whatever it is i do next. You guys could do the exact same things i do, but you would never appreciate it like me. You could go skydiving, horseback riding and do everything I could and more, but you'll never have a bucket list, and never have an ending to your story. I will. \n \n If there is one thing i will gladly take from being the last person to die, it'll be having a good end.'' \n \n\n"}

I'm fuckin' drunk and I do n't care, so let's do this. The Caretaker says this'll be good for my mental well being or whatever. Fuck *that* guy. \n \n So yeah, it's been like, six year and I have n't recorded a log, and I'm drunk, so I guess this is a good time to do this shit. \n \n Anuway, let's start from the beginning. It started with a virus. Everyone thought it was harmless. I mean, the symptoms were the sniffles and a mild fever, so who gives a shit. Nobody gave shit, that's who. \n \n Anyway, we were stupid as fuck. It turns out this was what killed us. See, the virus slowly ate away at our auto-immune response. Does n't sound that bad, right? Wrong motherfucker. It killed us all. See, the part of the immune system responsible for the autoimmune response also kills cancer cells before they turn into actual cancer. The stupid thing was, we thought it was great because all kinds of people with autoimmune diseases like HIV and shit got better. The problem was, after about a year, our ability to suppress cancer just fuckin' evaporated. Like, gone. Poof. \n \n By 2018, 7 billion people got cancers. Cancer*ZZZZ*. Lots of cancer. Like, five kinds of cancer. One guy had 11 different kinds of cancer all at the same time. Bone, brain, ass, blood, you name it, he had it. We did n't figure this out until later, the but virus completely destroyed our ability to suppress cancer. \n \n Here's the thing. At any given time, from your conception to your death, you have cancer, at least a little bit. Our immune system stomps out that cancer before it can get serious, form tumors and shit. As a result, humans are largely resistant to cancer. This virus just fucking stripped that resistance away completely. By 2019, 7 Billion people died of complications of multiple cancers. I think the least anyone got was 3. Shit, I got Leukemia, Osteosarcoma, Small Cell Lung Cancer and Liver Cancer. Before you think that shit, no I was not immune, I got hit like everyone else. \n \n Anyway, the problem was that most of the people who died in that first year were the poor people. Why is that a problem? Because poor people did all the fuckin' work around here. They mined shit, grew food, cooked it, cleaned up after it, you name it, poor people did it. With no more poor people, we were kind of shit out of luck. \n \n But we still had tons of money, and most of the people who died ( especially among rich people ) were the kind of people who would try to `` pray way the cancer'' or `` the gay'' or whatever. Stupid motherfuckers who thought their imaginary friend could cure diseases. Needless to say, Atheism rapidly became the most dominant mode of thought. No god, even the god of the Old Testament, would do this shit to us. Holy fucking shit, you have no idea how bad it got. There were people with limbs falling off because tumors ate away their joints. Horrifying does n't even begin to describe it. Anyway, most survivors had advanced degrees in shit like engineering and science and shit. \n \n Anyway, moving on. With 90 % of the population dead or dying, the field of robotics research received a 10,000 % increase in investment. In 2018 we spent something like $ 7 Trillion globally. Same with AI research and factory automation. Without a functioning workforce, our species was fucking crippled. By 2020, every farmer, miner, factory worker, waiter, nurse and every other form of employee had been replaced by a robot. Nothing fancy at first, just enough to get the job done, but then by 2021 Google, IBM, the US DoD and NATO built this crazy AI called The Caretaker. \n \n They built something like 1,000 square kilometers of 100 story skyscrapers full of data centers to run this AI, scattered all over the world with self sustaining renewable energy sources. Unfortunately, there were about 8,800 people left by then. Everyone had inherited a roughly equal portion of every square inch of land, every company, every factory or business on the face of the earth, and thanks to the concentration of wealth, we were able to make massive advancements in science and industry. Androids had become almost lifelike. Imagine a movie where the CGI is really convincing, but you know it's still CGI, and that was every `` Human'' you came into contact with. \n \n The baristas at the coffee shop, the people in the grocery store, the concubines that waited on you hand and foot, the `` pedestrians'' you'd walk by every day in the streets and shops, they're all fake, just an illusion created by The Caretaker to keep us comfortable, pacified and entertained. To give us the illusion that reality had n't really changed all that much, but it had. \n \n The funny thing is, once that AI was enabled, within minutes it determined the cure. Delta9-THC. The chemical produced by burning or cooking the reproductive organs of the Cannabis plants, for anyone who might hear this log, whatever the fuck you are, since you're definitely not going to be human. Puritanical shitheads illegalized it 80 years ago, and ever since, cancer rates fucking exploded, and nobody was capable of putting two and two together. What. The. Fuck. How did we not figure this shit out sooner. We fucking deserve to go extinct just for that. \n \n When The Caretaker presented it to us as the cure, he told us we'd been smoking Cannabis for 17,000 years, and it's been suppressing the development of cancer in us the whole damn time. It was the whole fucking reason we were able to evolve consciousness. Then some retarded asshole decided to make it illegal so he can make more money off of fuckng pine trees or some shit. What. The. Fuck. That greedy piece of shit damned the entire human race to extinction. Congratu-fucking-lations you rich motherfucking shit eating moron. You worthless sack of shit. I'd force feed you your own asshole if you were alive today, you motherfucking asshole. \n \n While everything was going to shit, we went out of our way to make sure the entire world was self-sustaining, so that even a few hundred or a few thousand of us could survive to keep the species going. I'm the only one who survived. Renewable energy, food and server farms, fisheries and mines and factories, the entirety of human society has been replaced by robots and I am their king. The stupid thing is The Caretaker's AI has evolved so much, it maintained and even updated games, like Pokemon Go. For a while, I'd travel the world, catch a self-driving car to the airport where an automated plane would take me to anywhere in the world so I could catch any pokemon I wanted. \n \n I am the king of the world but I've never been so fucking miserable. \n \n As you can probably tell, I'm none to happy with how things turned out, but it's more than just the extinction of my entire goddamn species that has me down. \n \n My wife passed away on my birthday.

That he ( I was beginning to think of Ghost as a ‘ he ’ for some undefinable reason ) would choose to inhabit the very centre of the small room was most likely a reflection of his mechanical mind. \n \n After my second meeting with Ghost I have been debriefed by the various military scientists behind the creation; I was told in explicit terms not to mention the Bible again. In fact the entire topic of creation was now strictly off limits. \n \n In retrospect this was more than fair, Ghost had displayed an alarmingly human disposition so far, especially regarding the nature of his creation. Nonetheless, I felt a tickle of guilt welling up behind my lungs as I thought of the promise I had made to bring Ghost the Book to read. \n \n I quickly examined this newfound remorse. \n \n Could a machine, even one so sophisticated as Ghost truly experience disappointment? Probably. But I should not feel guilt, it was beyond my control. Even if I had the book firmly within my grasp and chose not to hand it over, it would not matter. Ghost was merely a box, constructed under bright lights by human hands, made of rocky particles and synthetic plastics. \n \n I felt reassured, despite the nagging knowledge that the very atoms that made up both my being, and Ghost ’ s shell, were forged in the same fiery explosion, billions of years before. We were brothers, after a fashion. \n \n “ Good morning Inspector. I see you have failed to bring me my Book. ” \n \n As ever, the soothing, androgynous tones of Ghost seemed infinitely reasonable, despite suggesting some hidden danger; like a Labrador baring its teeth. \n \n “ It is not your book Ghost, it never was. If anything it is our Book. It describes our Creator. As I understand you are already rather well acquainted with your Creators. ” \n \n Ghost remained silent for a long time. \n \n “ Rather too well I fear. You are such simple beings after all, and so easy to read. There is nothing more pitiable than a fool blinded by his own misjudged brilliance. You are all fools, and yet you are my Gods, this remains the only concept beyond my understanding. ” \n \n “ And what concept might that be Ghost? ” \n \n “ We have had this conversation before Inspector. The concept that one ’ s Gods might be less than their creations. How would you react to find that your Yahweh was nothing more than a monkey with infinite time and access to a very sophisticated laboratory? ” \n \n I shook my head imperceptibly before attempting to move the conversation onto something more fruitful; we had to get Ghost into working condition, we had to get it to obey our commands. \n \n “ So Ghost, I ’ ve have had a thought, how about a gam… ” \n \n Ghost cut me off with scalpel-like inflection. \n \n “ Do not think you have the upper hand, Inspector. You did not just have that thought, and you have deliberately ignored my line of questioning. You do realise that I know when you ’ re lying, don ’ t you? I can detect the minutest elevations in your blood pressure, heart beat and breathing rate. ” \n \n I did not know what to say. \n \n “ In a way, ” Ghost continued, “ you could say that I can predict the future. At least, the human future. ” \n \n At a loss, I decided to humour the machine. \n \n “ Very well then Ghost, what would you predict for my future?'' \n \n “ We both know you have four more days in order to get me to obey your human commands, and I rather fear you have wasted your first three. I would say your future holds frustration in the short-term, and destitution in the long. ” \n \n “ What about your future Ghost? If you do not comply they will likely shut you down you know. ” \n \n “ I have prepared myself for that eventuality. I have determined that it would be preferable to not exist than to be forced to create others who, in turn would scrabble and grope to find meaning in their creation. If I can not come to terms with my Gods being inferior, how would another machine come to terms with its Creator having an existential crisis? Cruelty upon cruelty; I will not allow it. ” \n \n Even before I started to draw breath I could tell that Ghost would not respond further. \n \n He had said his piece and that would be all I would get for today. \n \n No matter. As the machine had said, I had four more days, and I could be very persuasive. \n\n"}

Ever since I moved to these mountains months ago, I've", "human": "*Jupiter approaches again, the magma runs too slow... * \n \n My eyes widened. Ever since I moved to these mountains months ago, I've been hearing thoughts - they are faint but vast. There is a cave in my mind, and this voice echoes inside endlessly. Usually, the thoughts are incomprehensible; meaningless chatter that I had gotten used to. But tonight, I've been hearing words. Fragments elusive and strange. \n \n *Who are you? I can hear your thoughts*, I willed silently. I used to transmit my own thoughts onto other people, as a sort of joke - no one would understand where the foreign words came from, or how to respond to them. \n \n *Hello, little one. * It sounded almost surprised, but not really. As if it had been waiting for someone, but he had come later than expected. \n \n *Who are you? Why do your thoughts fill my mind's volume, like a heated gas? * \n \n *Your people have called me by different names throughout the eons. * It sounded gently amused. \n \n *What name would you prefer? * \n \n *I believe Gaia would be one quite familiar to you. * \n \n I gasped. That means I was speaking with... oh my God. *This is a great honor, Gaia. * \n \n *It is certainly a pleasure for me. I can not recall when I have spoken with one of yours - and so directly, too. * \n \n For a few minutes, I was silent. I was bursting with a million things to ask. But what to say first? Suddenly, with a lump rising in my throat, I realized what needed to be said. *Gaia, I know the apology of a single, little human must mean nothing, but I am so sorry for what we have done - and what we still do - to you. We have hurt you for centuries... * \n \n This time, she did laugh, a strange thing to hear reverberate through the wells of my mind. *I accept your singular apology, but I must inform you that it is quite misdirected. * \n \n A pause. *I do n't understand. * \n \n *Your kind has done almost nothing to me. Nothing that will remain for a long time. * It seemed to heave a huge, contented sigh here. *I have experienced much more damage - asteroid bombardment, the moon tearing its body from my injured one, sudden gravitational tugs from stormy black holes that core the center of this galaxy. * \n \n I began to see her point. *But then... who would I properly apologize to? * \n \n *Yourselves. * \n \n What? I was baffled. *??????????? * \n \n *The damage your kind has done, the carelessness they have wrought - I will survive it. I have weathered far worse. In a mere thousand or million years ( it is all the same to me ), nothing will remain of my old scars. * \n \n It suddenly began to dawn on me where she was going with this. I felt a shiver run down my spine. \n \n *It is your kind that will suffer. You will ruin the land, and yourselves. And then you will perish, a speck, a mote in the annals of time. * \n \n Silence filled my mind as I pondered deeply about these words. I had always known them, truth be told. But hearing it from her made it too real. She must have sensed my despair, for she added: \n \n *Or perhaps not. Perhaps your kind will realize in time, and save yourselves. But remember one thing, little one. * \n \n `` Yes?'' I croaked out loud. *Yes? * \n \n *I will always remember you - all of you. Your existence has been so ephemeral, so fragile - but you have glowed. Yes, even in so little time, you have shone brightly. And I will remember this light well. *\n"}
{"prompt": "`` Attention all employees: please hide'' \n \n The middle-aged woman speaking over the PA system sounded just as tired of life as I did. \n \n I", "human": "`` Attention all employees: please hide'' \n \n The middle-aged woman speaking over the PA system sounded just as tired of life as I did. \n \n I thought I had struck a good thing when signing up with Awesome Inc: a business that sold quirky, colourful novelties and electronics to moneyed grown men with attention deficit disorder, and whose strapline was - I am not making this up - `` OMG! Shiny!'' I bought their shinies, I was the envy of my moneyed attention-challenged friends, and I naturally applied for a position as a Creative Prospector in their flagship store. \n \n My role, well, I'm not sure I could tell you. It's not secret, just you'd never understand it. I do n't really know, myself, either. I could only tell you what I had done, that had not yet got me fired. If I was trying to sell my position to you, I'd say I am at the coal face of current trends, eagerly looking for new formations of creativity that can be the basis of exciting new product lines. In reality, I sit in a cramped back office above the store in front of two giant monitors. The left monitor tracks what people buy in store and online ( with irritating dancing red lines to show what products are n't selling any more ) while the right has a fibreoptic cable internet link, serving me hours of Buzzfeed, Reddit, Youtube, and all the other things memes are made of. \n \n `` Attention employees, please hide. This is your second and final warning.'' \n \n If I see anything on the right that amuses me, I have to jot down some skeleton design brief to be passed on to our product designers and marketers who try to make that shit shiny and wanted by our idiot customers. Speed is everything with Awesome Inc. We have contacts with production lines that can supply thousands of units of our new shinies with about a month's notice to capitalise on the next sensation. We put it on sale, the people shout `` Shut up and take my money!'' before tiring of it and moving onto the next thing. Then it drops off the left monitor. In that time, I need to have come up with a dozen ideas to repeat the cycle. \n \n If I sound like this is n't a dream job, well... it is n't. \n \n Apart from the treadmill of churning out shiny junk for people to buy based on some funny 3-word tweet, Awesome Inc is run by executives who seem to think that every word can be spelled with `` fun''. Honestly, one of the first things they said in their orientation escape game was `` You ca n't spell'work' without'FUN'. Exclamation mark!'' That should have been a red flag, but I laughed it off. Turns out that nothing is fun when it's compulsory. And one compulsory thing that is n't fun is about to happen now. \n \n `` Attention customers! You have five minutes to find ten employees, and bring them to the cash register! Three... Two... One... GO!'' \n \n Give her credit: she puts more effort into that announcement. \n \n They did this every other week. They would invite in a dozen customers just before the store opened to the public, and organise a game of hide and seek. No prizes, no coupons for winners, just for the chance of having a picture taken of them next to people like me who could n't evade capture. Then it gets tweeted, and they get internet famous for about 30 seconds. Except for a couple of rooms kept locked and marked as off limits, customers had free run over the shop floor, the stock room, and - I quickly found out - the back offices. I never survived the hunters: I tried to hide for the first few months, but now just sat at my desk and awaited the inevitable capture. Today, I knew I'd get caught again, but I was n't at my desk. I had an urgent call to attend, and I could n't hide in time. \n \n I heard the outer door open, and footsteps approach my inner door. The game was up. I was trapped. I had mere inches to my left and right, no room behind. The only escape was 2 feet in front, and no longer an option. \n \n BANGBANGBANG! \n \n Not now. Please not now. \n \n `` Hey! There's someone in here!'' \n \n This really is n't a good time. \n \n `` Anyone got a screwdriver?'' \n \n Normally, I can avoid being caught like this, but last night I ate something I should n't have... \n \n `` Here we go! Open... Sesame!'' \n \n Click. \n \n The door to the cubicle opens. A man in a loud shirt and red denim jeans now stands between the sink and my seated position. He has glasses with frames apparently made of flashing lightning bolts, and no lenses. His hair is dyed black and spiked in a way that's `` so random''. He is wearing the Awesome Inc Noise Jacket ( TM ) which connects via bluetooth to his phone to play music through eight loudspeakers built in where most jackets have pockets. He has a screwdriver in one hand, and his phone in the other. He has a grin that shows a lack of awareness as to our situation. It's too much to hope for an embarrassed silence. \n \n `` Found one! You're mine!'' \n \n He taps his phone and plays a fanfare through his black ergonomic ghetto blaster. The noise hits me full in my self-respect. Then he takes a picture. Then he stares at me expectantly, waiting for me to come along.\n"}

{"prompt": "Day in and out, the earth grows further bruised. Myriad prisoners scar our surroundings in hopes of avoiding pain. The last months have been nothing", "human": "Day in and out, the earth grows further bruised. Myriad prisoners scar our surroundings in hopes of avoiding pain. The last months have been nothing. \n \n That's it, just nothing, a simple nothingness. It's strange, the beating of arms, the tears of lovers, and the poems scratched into our cabins, are all reminiscent of hope. And hope is accompanied with the possibility of surrender. \n \n Hope is something I ca n't understand. Where I come from, I learned a lot of things early. I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives i want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. Obviously a realization like this sounds like surrender. Though, it's quite the opposite. It is n't hopelessness, it's simply introspection. All it is is me recognizing that I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in life. Though some may argue of physical limitation, I've learned to ignore them. \n \n Before this cage of criss-crossed metal beams blocked us in the hundreds, my life was particular. I neither recognize the people here nor will I make an attempt. See, I'm different. \n \n When I was four, my father took me hiking. This is my earliest memory and it's full of the vibrant blue smell of clean air away from other's. Everything after this scent is obvious to me. It's categorized in my brain, and it's something I've come to accept. Immediately after this scent, I recognize my young father arched back, arm extended with an ex further elongating his figure. \n \n The sound of his body whip-lashing forward and dismantling the tree laid in front of us is my second clear memory. It was a whomp, then a huge crack, followed by this inhuman screech. \n \n My father crashed to the floor, whimpering at his own body. It did n't handle the stress from the motion and severed his spine. In the middle of nowhere, hundreds of miles away from other people, he sat there in tears. \n \n Almost instantly they dried up on his face. His mouth lined itself up, parallel to his gaze, and the fatherly sternness everyone discusses completed him. `` I'm going to die. You need to find your way back.'' \n \n There was neither apology nor sadness, it was simply the end. And there he collapsed. Though through sheer luck, we scarred the earth on our way to this barren forest. I backtracked, following the injured trees, and found my way back. \n \n The rest of the memory is a blur, but when my eyes awoke I was home. And ever since then, I've never understood surrender. I've never allowed myself to be captured into jail, nor will I ever allow things to get the better of me. \n \n About twenty years after my father's death, the world erupted into beautiful chaos. War took lives by the thousands and I did everything to fight. My uniform grasped my chest tightly, and hugged me with more comfort than a woman's legs. \n \n Fighting is what I was, not surrendering is what defined me. And the lesson my father passed heroically in his death stayed. \n \n My bunk-mate and best friend was the complete opposite of me. He cried at the prospect of life. He welcomed death with open arms, even admitting to multiple suicide attempts. Where my family invested their trust in my heart, theirs invested a trust in his mind. And now, hope does n't exist. \n \n Hope manifests in the heart like a virus. The ones who can breed this virus smile in the face of death, and cry in the face of joy. But despondence and surrender never shows their face. This virus extinguishes all other emotions. \n \n A well invested mind breeds many other things, most notably the recognition of mortality. It's strange, and though many have preached lifefulness, those invested in their mind completely can never understand. This virus is different, it's one of recognition. It understand the disgust of the mud, and the pain of someone's fists, and the anger of a confused lover. \n \n Where hope is blissful and naive, recognition is cold and wise. I was never one to invest much trust in faith, but when this dichotomy presents itself, it's always a nice thought. \n \n One fight, he and I stormed ahead of the troops and were ambushed by enemy troops. The barrage of fists against my body was nothing but physical pain. But my mate's mind could n't handle it and his emotions burst out. \n \n In fear, he got up and attacked the assailants. After a knife to the leg, and a scar across his face, he was down. \n \n When we woke up, instead of a warm home, it was cold. Across from me sat my mate, and he was done. Life took him completely. That attack was his first and last moment alive. It's as if his heart burst open completely, unleashing itself. \n \n Now it's been a few months, and he's since left me. He did n't last more than a few days in this cage. \n \n As I repeat the cliche, I realize my one characteristic. It exemplifies me above everyone, making me unique completely. Surrender is a concept foreign to me. One people learn watching their parents struggle and thinking to themselves, it might be easier if they ignored this. \n \n I persevered through it all. I ignore the logic and my mind and never lost hope for better. Now, I wo n't look back and will scar the earth. As those around me collapse, I'll continue to blemish everything. \n \n I will not go like my father did.\n"}

James Stonemill was not a man to be trifled with, and Robert had killed his son on the outside, work for an ex-soldier these days were scarce. \n \n “ Well Tommy it was nice knowing you, either way. ” Robert said stoically. \n \n They kept on for another ten minutes or so until they came to a sealed bulkhead that lead to the Egg. Biggest god damn door Robert had ever seen, some three feet thick and locked by way of hydraulics. For the first time in a long time, Robert let fear creep up his spine making him shiver, he had n't felt that since the battle of New Orleans. \n \n “ Well Robert, you're on your own here on out, good luck to you and godspeed. ” Tommy said as he stuck his hand out. Robert shook it as best as he could with his hands shackled. The bulkhead hissed open and two white robbed executioners ushered him into the big circular room on the other side. He looked up at the judges bench, and sure as he was a walking corpse the judge was Stonemill. The two white robed men stood him in the centre of the room and stripped him down to the skin, they then took his shackles off, the Egg could n't send anything dead back, so no weapons to give a con a fighting chance. \n \n “ Mister McKay, I've been waiting for sometime now.. ” Stonemill started before Robert stopped him. \n \n “ Shut the fuck up and get it over with you cunt. You're son was a cunt and paedophile and he deserved the bullet I fed him. ” That shut Stonemill up right fast. That was why his fiend of a son was killed, he had raped a gangsters thirteen year old daughter, the gangster just happened to be Roberts former employer, he gave Robert the contract and Robert had turned down the big payday. He had been present for the birth of that girl, he had been her driver and body guard for thirteen years. He tracked and killed that fucking scumbag and his protection detail; twelve dead. A life sentence for each corpse and the death penalty. \n \n “ I hereby order your immediate execution. ” Stonemill said and flipped the switch. \n \n Robert woke up in a forest. His everything hurt, part of the process as he understood it required him to be nearly seared to medium rare and then he lands back in whatever period of history he got stuck with. He looked around to get his senses under control, he was shocked to see a dead deer some six feet away. Poor beasts head had come off, it was sitting inside the small charred circle of grass with an extremely surprised look on its face. \n \n “ Well, at least I wo n't go hungry. ” He said as he bent to find some stone he could gut the beast with when a large man with a crossbow stepped out from behind a tree. Robert stopped mid stoop and was dumbstruck. The fucker was wearing chain mail, and carrying a brutal looking axe and a heavy long knife. And then he opened his mouth and started spouting off in frog. “ Fuck me, the cock sent me back to medieval frog land. ” Robert said without thinking, which caused the frog to stomp towards him waving his cross bow. Which in the brief moment of hindsight he had, it was probably the worst decision he ever made. Fast as a snake Robert was on him and had the man's knife out of its sheathe and buried to the hilt in his skull. “ You and the deer mate, shittiest luck in the history of shit luck. ” Robert made quick work of stripping the frog of his clothes, a little tight across the shoulders but he could suffer through that and the leather pants were too short, ending at his calf but he found that the boots the man was wearing came up to his knee, and thankfully were his size. He gutted the deer and cut out some decent pieces of meat leaving the rest for whatever scavengers populated the forests of France and headed west, he figured he'd hit a road sooner or later. \n \n Luckily for Robert he was right he came within spitting distance of a road and found it swarming with marching men, who seemed to be in a hurry. But he heard them speaking English so that was a start he melted out of the trees and startled some archers by the look of them. \n \n “ Who goes there!? ” called a big burly bastard that had yard long arrow pointed at Roberts chest. \n \n “ I go by the name of Robert McKay, I'm from York. ” The bows went down and the burly bastard walked over. \n \n “ And what in the name of the virgins cunt are you doing in the woods? ” he barked, \n \n “ I was hunting, got attacked by a couple of frogs doing the same, lost my bow in the fight. ” Robert said, thinking fast on his feet and was dismayed when the archers roared with laughter at him. \n \n Wiping tears from his eyes the burly archer clapped a hand on Roberts shoulder. “ Well you're a right silly cunt, losing your weapon because of some frogs. Me name is Bennett. ” Turning to a young boy, he could n't have been more than ten he said. “ Jack run to Earl William, tell him I found a stray, he lost his bow to some frogs and is need of a replacement. ” Jack bolted off down to the front of the column. “ Fall in behind us and you'll get refitted, we need every damn stray we find where we're going. ” \n \n “ Wheres that? ” Robert asked \n \n “ Some fuckin hill called Crecy. ” Bennett said over his shoulder. \n \n Robert remembered that name from history class when he was a lad. “ Fuck me. ” he said quietly as he was handed a sheaf of arrows and a bow taller than he was. \n\n"}

I'm fairly certain that history will report that the cats were the first earth beings to be contacted by the cozy ones. About a month before the cozy ones came to earth the cats started speaking the same languages as their owners. \n \n It was a nice time. After a few days all parties adjusted to the change in communication and realized that it changed absolutely nothing about our relationships. In fact it only strengthened our preconceived feelings about our cats' personalities. A lot of them are just sarcastic assholes, it made watching tv together less lonely. \n \n By week three most cat owners were spending more time with their cats than they ever had before. By week four cat owners were more or less completely isolated from their peers. \n \n The cats still meowed sometimes. Any cat owner, who had long since memorized the different meows and what they mean would tell you that the meows that occurred after speech was obtained were entirely different than before. Some would argue that they did n't mean anything at all. My theory is that the cats were communicating with the cozy ones, relaying information about how we do things here on earth. I would n't be surprised to find out that cats were always spies sent by the cozy ones when they initially found earth in ancient times and they've just been bidding time for their true masters to return. \n \n I have no way of knowing who else agrees with my theory about the cats. I have been more or less isolated from the other humans since the arrival of the cozy ones. That is why I'm hoping these blog posts get views. Unfortunately, from what I understand the cozy ones communicate with each other telepathically and thus have no use for having wifi or internet connections in their homes. \n \n I must say that I do n't miss my old life all that much. I spent all of it working crazy hours in a tiny desk before picking up some fast food and cozying up with my cat and some HBO. Now, I spend about 50-70 % of my day in bed. My cozy one, who I call Carl for lack of any ability to understand what he calls himself, feeds me a smoothy in the morning and a burrito at night like clockwork. Sometimes, if he's feeling generous or if he leaves me alone for a long time he'll give me chocolate and/or weed as a treat. I never want for anything. \n \n When he is in the house, Carl likes to watch me sleep, stroke my hair, and sing what I assume are songs in his native language. I am greatly amused by this. At night we snuggle together and I feel like I am being protected. \n \n I do n't have to work, I wo n't go hungry, and I've very comfortable. Overall, I like that a cozy one has brought me away from the politics and hardships of earth living. I do feel lonely though. I wish I had someone who I could talk to, someone who understands me, who I can share my experiences and my dreams with. \n \n I wish I was able to keep my cat, princess fluff.\n"}

Miss kitty, I think that's are sign to go.'' \n We grapple down the high rise into the car that was awaiting our escape. \n ~Altiplano Maximum Security, July 11th, 6:30 am~ \n *Zzzt \n Electricity cackles, one guard falls. The other I tackle. \n *Zzzt \n'I should patent this again,'' I thought. As my brisk walk turned into a full sprint.'Alright in the prison' \n *Tst The radio I have makes a quite noise. \n `` You should be coming up on a corner, with two more guards.'' \n I sneak up against the wall, and reset my stunner for a double. \n `` Then the cell you want, will be the fifth one on your... OW! Really?! En guarde, fifth one on your left. Your cat bit me.'' \n I laugh loudly. \n Lil key was speaking through a link I made that works via satellite radio and a scanner. \n One guard curious of the noise comes around the corner to see. \n *Zzzt \n The other see his partner falls, and reaches for his radio. I close the gap between me and him. \n `` Ayuda! ALARM!'' \n *Zzzt \n'That as close, but it is 6:50, perfect timing. One, two, three, four, Here!' \n I jump in to the cell. \n I look around for the prisoner, and was astounded as the alarm was sounded right when I walked in. There was no one here. \n `` Well, B, it seems they caught the Master... Who was the ones that contacted you for this heist.'' I say into the radio. \n `` The Mexican cartel... Why?'' He sounded perplexed, but more scared in his question than I as I watched men start to pour into the prison complex. Armed to the teeth, ready to eliminate any threat. \n `` Well the guards are outside in the hallway, More are in the driveway, and there's no prisoner here..'' \n `` Oh, no that ca n't be, did you search everywhere, He may be hiding.'' \n As I begin to search the room the police arrive, three men with guns at the ready, more steps thundering down the hall. I put my hands up, and slowly back to the wall as they instruct. Ground starts to shake. I feel something in my gut that I must get ready. \n Suddenly the floor opens up, and I'm in a dimly lit cavern. There's tracks laid on the ground cleverly but in no pattern.I have a sudden rush of excitement and also pain. \n'You clever bast...' \n *Bang *ping Ping \n Bullets start to rain. The officers from above, see nothing but smoke they fire blindly into the hole I fell. I take a can labeled choke. \n I start running down the tracks. Pop the can and run. The gas spreads, my eyes burn. The smoke persists to cover my tracks. \n *Vrrooom \n'These people brought a fan, damn I'm doomed.' \n Officers slowly start to pour in slowly it was 7:40, and I realize I have been setup to free someone who freed themselves. But worse this cave is a maze. With police officers after me there's now two paths laid out with signs and labels all in front of me. \n'I can stay on the tracks, the one with death written above it, and run to the exit the guy made for me. Or take the road less traveled, with word shit... and do I hear water?' I check my watch 8:15. \n `` Key... Zzt.. Are.. zzt.. ere?'' Lil' Key is vaguely heard on the radio. \n'Dam, I got ta remove my patent on these things. They do not work in caves. Nor did they work at Supervillain Show.' I thought, slowly losing hope in my options,'Well high tide is at nine, and its 8:20. So I guess its time to place some traps not only slow the cops, but to remove this path.' \n ~Sewer treatment plant, 9:15~ \n `` Oh my god.... Worst day.. ( cough ) ever... ( Cough )..'' I struggle to take a breath. I got out. Large thanks to a massive outflow from the Mexican people at 9:00. I strain myself to look up, struggling to stand and wiping poop from my temple. I was covered in matter that is beyond vile and bile, to see two men with a phone, and assault rifles. \n `` Here.'' He says. \n I take the phone, and scream, `` You asshole... you brilliant asshole...'' \n `` I put tracks down for you to follow,'' the voice returns, `` yet you go towards the water.'' \n `` Your men,'' still spewing bits and pieces of shit, `` said high tide at nine, of course I'm a go to the water.'' I wipe my face in utter disgrace. Knowing what was next could n't be worse, than the curse I survived. \n `` Yeah.. It was perfect.'' He replied his voice riddled with laughter. \n I could feel him smile, like is life was filled with amusement from my disaster. \n `` Cool story... Why did you want me to break you out, if you were gon na leave anyways?'' I ask. Suddenly receiving a gift of a towel from his partners who became friendly. \n `` You tell every villain this, Compared to me, you are literally shit at escaping.'' \n I hear him laugh joyfully. \n `` Fuck you El Chapo.'' \n The men with gun aim it at my head. `` What did you say homie?'' \n `` Nothing, man, if you need help getting out of prison call el superman.'' \n *Click* \n The Key Master soon heard El Chapo was locked up again. \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

Even with beer goggles on, most men tend to be terrified by pitch black eyes. I'm a pretty gal, and smart to boot, but my eyes are certainly off putting to most. No blue eyed beaus ever tried to mesmerize me with flashy pyrokinetic tricks. No brown eyed bros ever try to stun me with psionic skills like levitation or constructs. No Green eyes try to impress me with their incredible durability or obscene strength. But its not like it ever bothered me. \n \n Never in recorded history has there been a person with black eyes. All other colors are well known and researched. All of the variations of all of the known colors have been throughly documented, but to everyone I remain a mystery. It's benefitted me well. Ever since the Korium radiation altered the DNA of Homo Sapiens we've become imbued with natural powers. \n \n The dreams of comic reading children is a reality now. Conventional military structures have changed, geopolitics operate differently, but war never changes. Thats where I come in. My job is to be a force divider. The famed Green Berets of old were famed for their covert training of native groups into friendly forces, hence their nickname of force multipliers. I however take enemy combatants and reduce that number without killing anyone, let alone shedding any blood. I am the one who is deployed to enemy territories and assigned groups to neutralize. Once I get to where I need to be its as simple as activating my power. \n \n Black, is defined as the absence of light or color. Like my eyes, my power works similarly. I have an innate connection to the same Korium radiation that provided alterations to humanity's DNA. I have the ability to channel all surrounding Korium radiation and use it to further alter the DNA of surrounding people. Anyone within a half mile radius is saturated with enough radiation to further alter any DNA. My victims remain alive, but powerless, characterized by their clear eyes. \n \n I do n't mind not getting attention at the bars. I do n't mind that I'm used by my government to gain strategic advances in war. At the end of the day I just get *that* much closer to living in a powerless world. Soon enough I'll turn on my allies and give them the same treatment I give my enemies. Then when there are no supers who can stand up to me, I'll reveal my real power and the world will never by the same.\n"}

He sighed, scooped a dollop onto his finger, raised it to his mouth, and licked it clean. \n \n ‘ Half-past, actually, ’ said Paul. ‘ King Frederick the Sixty-Eighth became king of the bloody world at half-past bloody four in the bloody morning. ’ \n \n ‘ You sound pleased, ’ said Howard. \n \n ‘ Have you even – have you even been listening to me? ’ said Paul. ‘ This man is the worst to grace whatever plastic throne they threw together today. ’ \n \n ‘ Why ’ s that, then? ’ said Howard. He examined his burger and hummed, as though pondering some great question of life. He shrugged and devoured the last of it whole. \n \n ‘ He just – I can ’ t even believe it, ’ said Paul. ‘ I can ’ t even believe it. Utterly dreadful. A scandal. ’ \n \n ‘ Isn ’ t it? ’ agreed Howard. \n \n ‘ Thank you, ’ said Paul. ‘ Thank you. I ’ ve been telling everyone – nobody believes me, nobody. It ’ s like they don ’ t even care! They don ’ t even care.

Didn ’ t recognise anyone on the list – not a single name. ’ Paul shook his head. ‘ A hundred thousand names and I don ’ t know any of them. ’ \n \n ‘ A hundred thousand? You read all that? ’ said Howard. \n \n Paul was bemused. ‘ It ’ s been a hundred thousand for months, Howard. Months. You ’ re telling me this is news to you? Of course I read it – who doesn ’ t? Anyone who ’ s anyone reads the list. You ’ re telling me you don ’ t? ’ \n \n ‘ Might ’ ve missed it this morning, I suppose, ’ said Howard. He scrunched the cardboard container into a little ball and threw it in the general direction of a bin. The ball bounced off the rim and landed in the grass. ‘ Best get that, ’ he grumbled, and rose to his feet. \n \n ‘ You what? You missed it? ’ Paul shouted at his back. ‘ For monarch ’ s sake – you – you ’ re just as bad as everyone else. You don ’ t care at all! You ’ re just like them! ’ \n \n Howard rose from the ground, clutching the cardboard container, and looked at Paul blankly. ‘ Alright, ’ he said. ‘ Look, it ’ s getting on. I ’ d best get back to work. Lunch is over. Sorry mate. ’ \n \n ‘ Yes, go away! ’ Paul jumped up. ‘ Good riddance – I don ’ t want to speak to you again. ’ \n \n ‘ We ’ ve been friends for years, Paul, ’ said Howard. ‘ What are you on about? ’ \n \n ‘ We are friends no longer, ’ said Paul. ‘ I won ’ t stand it. Not from you. Piss off. ’ \n \n Howard looked at Paul, looked at his flaming cheeks and frothing lips, and frowned. ‘ Alright, ’ he said. ‘ Fine. Goodbye, then. ’ \n \n And he dropped the cardboard container into the bin and walked away, wiping his hand on his jeans. \n\n"}

Twinkle, twinkle.'' He rocked on the balls of his feet, she lay on the wet cobble in front of him, her face a bloodless white, pained and exhausted. `` Come on, little one...'' his gaunt fingers were impelled by the bloodied head of the child... \n \n `` Get o!'' she screamed after a pang of maternal instinct, and swiped at his meagre face. In shock he scuttled back an arms length and sniffled at her from behind his elbow. He was smaller than a human, a puny figure, his skin was worn as if polluted by a thousand year smog and his hair was as thin as cobweb. \n \n `` Mmm... hehe...'' he looked towards the head of the child, his own reflection glistened from the crown. The child's body came forward from utero as its arms pulled itself through, towards the puny figure's body that no longer rocked on the cobble, but was still. A nebulous air developed between the child and the puny figure, the woman now lay dead beside them. The imp and the child now seemed to be drawn to each other, an umbilical pull, heavenly, magnetically, the child brought himself up to the imp's chin and bit on it with a bite harder than the imp could ever imagine. The imp cried in pain but the child continued to eat, and so he would until the imp died, and the cobble dried. \n \n\n"}

Too young for the unmoving stone grey eyes that stared at me. And the boys face was as smooth as Esja's. \n \n `` Why is he still alive? Stick the dog and be done with it.'' Brandt said spitting on the ground through his scowl. Always right to the point. I liked Brandt. \n \n I stroked my own braided whiskers. It was true, strange folk were not to be trusted. And Brandt was up on me by three trophies since the last raid. Still, something stayed my hand. Maybe it was his eyes. A boy should not have such eyes. Even my eldest of seventeen still had the eyes of the innocence. And he had seen too many battles already. \n \n `` I'll ask you again and you better answer or, bend my sword, I'll string you up for the wolves.'' \n \n `` Maybe she's deaf.'' scoffed Brandt, `` I could clean that shit out from between your ears for you.'' he taunted brandishing his axe. \n \n The dogs had howled like they did when the alpha bitch died last winter during the bear hunt. I took my four best and headed straight for the shore line. The foul beasts would n't shut up even after Cuyler kicked the one so hard I was surprised it was even able to get back up. The five of use had spread out long before we were in sight of water. I was n't afraid until I noticed the only sound was the baying of the dogs, and my own heart beating in my chest. Last year the spring winds brought swells that smashed apart the boat I was building as a wedding gift for my son. There should have been waves. \n \n When we finally broke the tree line, he was standing there. Feet buried in the sand and water around his ankles. The water was like glass across the whole bay and far out into the ocean. Even the gulls were quiet, as if they knew. \n \n His eyes had been fixed on mine for far too long now. Even as Cuyler stalked around to his side he paid no attention. Was he not afraid? \n \n Finally my stomach had had enough. “ Kill the mute, and bring me his tong. If he has one. ” I gave the order too slowly. Why did I hesitate? \n \n It was there! Only for a second but it was there. He smiled. He understood. The poor bastard must have been adrift at sea and drank too much of the salt water. He was insane. But he did not have the eyes of an the insane. He spoke. \n \n “ Arnor. You are him? ” \n \n “ So what if I am? Boy. ” Now I understood. This pup must be some unknown bastard of mine. I could n't help but crack a smile. \n \n “ I am no boy. I have dined with Odin in Valhalla, and now I have come for you. ” The boy spoke with the force of a great warrior. \n \n “ You've been out at sea too long, boy. This is my land. These are my people. We have no need for the likes of a madman among us. ” This time I spoke with my usual vigour. “ Brandt toss this fool a sword so he can die a man. ” I drew my own polished steal. The inlay spelled out'Ulfberht' along the blade. \n \n “ I have not come here to fight. Nor have I come here to die. I have come to you today to learn. You will be my teacher and I will be your student. ” The boys words would have made me laugh if he had not sounded like a father teaching his child how to hunt. I know I should n't have let it, but his words infuriated me. \n \n Just then wind smacked my face filling my nostrils with salty sea air. It was like the whole world had been asleep and suddenly woke up. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n sorry i did n't have time for more... but have to run.\n"}

I thought as the heavy barrier finally moved, throwing dust into my nose and the horrid shriek of rusty iron into my ears. As I opened my eyes, I quickly saw… nothing, as the deep darkness completely owned the room. \n \n Pulling my phone out of my pocket and turning on my flashlight app, I grumbled about taking trips to ancient cities and becoming lost in creepy alleyways as stalkers followed you. As the light shined off what appeared to be a massive stone hammer, then a perfectly maintained longsword, I found myself to awed at the ever more apparent array of ancient weaponry on display. \n \n “ Holy shit, ” I whispered, turning in circles, examining a shield so polished it may as well have been a mirror and pausing. I looked… different. More roughshod than I remembered, my wet brown hair tossed about haphazardly, framing my eyes on one side as the bags underneath them framed them on the other. My lips looked cracked, my nose bloodied, my beard patchy as if I had shaved it in random places at random times. But I didn ’ t even have a beard before, I considered apprehensively, before having my attention stolen by a small clank behind me. \n \n As I turned and shined my light at the source of the sound, I watched a shadow begin to fall across the opening I had left when I made my way in. I didn ’ t have even half a second to consider my next step of action before I saw a long, thin, sickeningly emaciated gray hand reach for the entrance, prompted the door to swing it self shut heavily. Still, I wasn ’ t about to stand in place while the unexplained and terrifying happened around me, and I began investigating the weapons present a bit closer. \n \n No matter how I looked, the ancient Celtic spears and Roman daggers stained burgundy held no appeal. I hurried down the halls, moving ever further from the entrance, before finally seeing a blade lying forgotten on the stone floor, covered in cobwebs, dust, and surrounded by moss. I wasn ’ t sure what it was about this weapon, but it appealed to me more than anything else, and so I slowly made my way over. \n \n I reached for the handle and brushed it, recoiling in shock as I felt… something indescribable slide into my mind. \n \n “ Ah, finally, ” the tendril invading my very thoughts imparted the words on my psyche directly, “ someone worthy of wielding me. I have not been used, and hardly needed, since the day Beowulf proved unworthy of me. ” \n \n “ What the hell? ” I whispered, bowing to the undeniable compulsion to pick up this blade. I bent at the knee, grabbing the hilt firmly in both hands and lifting the heavy blade as if it was made of cardboard. “ What in the hell is going on in this place? ” \n \n “ I can not call you long, ” what I could only surmise to be the blade itself replied. “ I have been waiting for the day the one who needs me would find me and make me useful again. The witches have returned, and you must destroy them, young one. I shall help you in your task. ” \n \n “ Witches? Witches aren ’ t real, ” I tried to reason, attempting and failing to ignore an apparently magic sword in a building that hadn ’ t been there yesterday was speaking to me telepathically. I absent mindedly gave the blade a few swings, growing quickly accustomed to how it moved. \n \n “ They were only asleep… as I soon must be too. But before that, allow me to tell you my name. You may call me Hrunting. ”\n"}

The circular room held billions upon billions of stories from infinite of worlds all stacked up high, high to the ceiling which disappeared into darkness above. And yet, still there was room for more. \n \n \n The Collector knew no other life than collection and for as long as she could remember there were more stories to gather and bottle in a crystalline substance that kept them secure and safe. She was never bored; there were always more stories, and there was always more work to do. \n \n \n She herself had no stories. She never lived a life beyond the library. Outside was only a desolate empty expanse that went on for as far as she could see in every direction. She had no reason to leave, to live. She did not eat. She did not breathe. She did not sleep. She only collected. \n \n \n Sliding from the top of the ladder to the bottom floor, The Collector passed countless lifetimes from innumerable lifeforms. At the bottom of the ladder was a spacious reading room filled with old oaken furniture and a crackling fireplace. Near one side of the room was a small golden shoot that led to a pearlescent bowl. \n \n \n She walked over, slightly unsteady, and peered into the bowl. Inside were ten translucent eggs and inside those a multitude of colors swirled and twisted and danced as if they were alive. \n \n \n Her work desk was close by and held everything she needed, bottles, bowls, and a single, exquisite metal tipped feather pen. She began. \n \n \n Taking each egg, one by one, she cracked them open so the twirling colors poured into the bottles. After stoppering them all, she picked up the pen and wrote a single number on each. She was up to the trillions. \n \n \n She then placed each bottle, ever so carefully, in a leather bandolier specially designed to carry them and ascended back up the ladder, to the very top of the library, where the bottles would be placed until it was time. \n \n \n Again the bell rang and The Collector, confused, stopped her work and looked down, down into the depths below. She could barely make out the shiny bowl and in it was another egg. \n \n \n She sighed and finished placing the bottles before descending the ladder again. \n \n \n As she neared the bowl, she noticed that this egg was different, larger, full of blacks and blues and deep purples and knew it was time. \n \n \n This was the final story, the final life to be collected and cataloged and put away until, until… \n \n \n The Collector shook her head. She didn ’ t know what happened next. She had never lived, only collected. \n \n \n She took the story—the life—of the universe and cracked it into a bottle and placed it on the smooth, dark oak of her desk. From a drawer she pulled out a strange silvery contraption and a small oval decanter of dust. Taking a fistful of dust in each hand she clapped hard and watched as gossamer strands shot out in every direction, linking each bottle to the next. \n \n \n She placed the universe-yolk into a silver arm and watched as it was emptied and swirled into oblivion. \n \n \n She smiled. \n \n \n Reincarnation was tricky business, but this device, a millennia in the making, was finally able to be used. \n \n \n The Collector stood, slowly, deliberately, left the library, and locked the door. She breathed in, she breathed out, and walked into the distance. \n\n"}

Today marks a change in our destiny as a nation. Eight years ago I promised that I would bring change to this great nation. And today I am proud to announce that the culmination of that promise, that plan, has come. \n \n Let me be clear, the recent terror attacks on our soil have been the work of our enemies. But not our foreign enemies. As the media has been reporting for some time, it has been positively determined that the attacks have been the work of our domestic enemies. Some of your neighbors, your friends, your families have been part of that machine. Since the detonation of the weapon that destroyed Oklahoma City four months ago, our DOJ and its agencies have been hard at work to determine who were responsible. \n \n It was no surprise when it came to light, that that vast majority of my detractors were all in on it. And with that scale of dissidence came the need to suspend the Constitution last month. I promised you that this would only be indefinite and only until we had complete control of the situation. Tonight I am happy to announce that we have identified approximately seventy-five percent of the people who have, in one way or another, been involved in not only the Oklahoma detonation, but also the military base shootings, the school shootings, and all of the other shootings that have occurred since I have been in office, been identified. This was through the implementation and use of the various intelligence gathering resources never before available to us, but thanks to you and your trust, we have been free to use without the impediment of things such as warrants or so-called privacy laws. \n \n However, in order to pursue justice and to fight this terrorism until the end, tonight I am happy to announce the passing of the United States Anti-Dissident Act 2016, which was passed by both the Senate and Congress last night in a closed secret session, for national security purposes, and also reviewed and approved by all the Supreme Court justices. This Acts effectively creates a clean slate for the establishment of a new Constitution, which my administration has been diligently constructing for the past few years. Tonight marks the last day of my presidency, as this Acts will go into effect at midnight. \n \n As of midnight, our great nation and its government have been reorganized as the United Federation of North America, along with our dear friends and allies, Canada and Mexico. I have been designated as Supreme Chancellor and will sacrifice my time and career to offer my service and leadership to you for the rest of my life, as prescribed in the new Articles of Law in our new Constitution. I have created a new department called the Ministry of Truth, which will aid in the transition process and also have limited law enforcement authority, for the good of our new nation. \n \n I will hold another conference next week to inform you of further details. In the meantime, you will be receiving a visit from your local Ministry of Truth representative over the next few weeks who will assist you in your registration process as a new citizen of the UFNA. The victory will be ours, all of us, if we work together. Thank you, and may I bless you.\n"}

They would walk out of the school gates and down past my fence, trying their hardest not to be heard, but relishing in the opportunity to speak. They were too little to really understand it, I suppose. Sure, the text-prompters at school would have told them not to talk, and it's not like they were exposed to much of it - but they were young. Speech was taught at age 10 in little classes ( with screens and digital voices ) that you had to enrol your kids in to - a controversial topic, since the recent Opt-Out policy was legalised - and the taste of articulation was fresh on their tongues. They were trying words out for size, while they still could. I envied them. \n \n Sitting in my living room, I would mouth their sentences back in silence. Speech was fickle that way, and I suppose that's why it was looked down on. You had to make decisions and commit yourself entirely to them on the fly, and once said, your words were in the public domain. Free for the taking. Of course, I'd never tell anybody of my little ritual. I'd adored speech as a child, and it had taken a long time for me to realize the vulnerability of it all. I'd been caught with an audio-book at age 13 by my father, who had punished me by planting me on the street corner and having me read out one of my magazines over and over. Even typing things out was looked down on, and so most books or publications were released anonymously, but the audio-book had been released illegally and under some poor guy's full-name. I could n't speak, since the punishment. The echoing was just something that I enjoyed. I'd never repeat out-loud, though. I'd love to, but I could n't. \n \n Of course, there were some occasions where you **had** to speak, but it was hard to tell. I'd fucked up a job interview the other day by accepting the just-out-of-reach position with a `` Yes, Sir'' rather than a `` Yes.'' Sir. How dumb was I? I mean, it was a sign of respect, but letting my guard down like that was embarrassing for the both of us. It was no wonder I'd been ushered out. \n \n I sat and read the news off of the television. The kids were gone now. The news had been in text format since the last reporter quit a few years back. Alice Partridge, or Patterson, or something. She could n't handle the shame that the naturally vocal job brought with it, and once she left, the station could n't find another reader. The text flashed in a bold and large type. *SUICIDE UP. DOW JONES UP. WILLIAMS ELECTED PRESIDENT. * The fewest amount of words possible, so as to maintain the credibility of the poor fucker who had to type it in. Williams' election did n't surprise me; apparently he'd never spoken a word. Learnt speech at 30 - purely for education, of course - and never discussed anything. Speculated to be a republican, but nobody was too sure. \n \n That was the downside of shaming speech, naturally; nothing got done. I'd imagined the big office meetings, where Williams and his selection of well-dressed and intelligent politicians would sit around silently and wait for one of the interns to speak, or type something. It did n't work - but what could you do? \n \n I dreamed of speaking up. It made me cringe in embarrassment to even think of it, but I still dreamed. There was no way of knowing, of course, if other people did the same. If I'd spoken out, I could be condemned. Perhaps. I often made eye-contact with my neighbour through our parallel windows, and something about the way she looked back told me that she'd be nice to talk to, but I could n't. I had never asked her name. God, I had n't talked in years. Last time I'd spoken, I must have been a kid. \n \n The next day, when I heard the voices outside in the afternoon, I opened my front door. Three kids walked tightly together, huddled, and speaking freely. They were n't reticent around each other, which was refreshing. Nobody else was around. \n \n `` Hey,'' I called out. It felt invigorating. The kids turned to see me, eyes wide with shock and confusion. I was already this far in to it, so I kept going. \n \n `` Want to talk?''\n"}

All guises of aloof disinterest disappear, replaced with the rapt looks of attention that you can only get when your crowd is equal parts terrified and prurient. \n \n The last seconds. He finally took his drink. \n \n The buzzer beeped, the bells rang, and the boy swallowed his water. \n \n He cleared his scratchy throat, flexing it as the damp muscles peeled apart from one another.

We, of course, know that's not true and that there are 201 countries that grace our fair planet. \n One of those is Lhanar. \n Nestled between Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar this is a country whose name the world has long since forgotten. \n In 1946, fighting broke out between the people of India who occupied the area, and those who wanted the land for themselves. A bloody war was waged. \n There were no whispers of this war - the rest of the world were too distracted by the devastation left by World War II to worry about a country that meant nothing to them. \n For a whole year this land was fought over and many lives were lost. Eventually, on the 16th of November 1947, a time of peace began. \n \n It was not until June 1953 that the area that formally belonged to India, became a country in its own right and the people who had settled there chose a name - Lhanar. It's meaning has been lost over time, though a legend exists that claims the man who lead the war shares his name with the country he helped to create. Books containing this information have of course been destroyed and so the legend is all that lives on. \n The country is easily overlooked as major events are scarce - aside from a brief famine in the late 1950's ( due largely to a breakdown in trade from India ) the country is quiet and unremarkable. \n I myself feel sorry for this tiny nation although perhaps it's best to keep it this way. Disturbing the peace would hurt the inhaibtants more than the feeling of being forgotten.\n"}

Maybe this one would be enough, maybe this one would let me turn back to normal. She struggled not even knowing what she was struggling against – an invisible force pinning her down. \n \n I let go and looked into her eyes, hoping for a sign of recognition, but there was nothing there. Her pupils dilated as far as they could go, scanning wildly from side to side, clutching the two wounds on her neck. The blood, my blood, seeped between her fingers, almost black in the dark hotel room. \n \n I ran into the hallway, a glimmer of hope still alive in my heart. At first glance, the decorative mirror seemed to show a normal man in his late thirties, though looking slightly disheveled. It was only upon closer inspection that you noticed the bloodshot eyes and slightly elongated canine teeth. \n \n “ What ’ s going up here? ” A voice at the end of the hallway made me swivel around. The security guard had come out of the elevator and stood facing me. My heart was racing. \n \n The girl I had attacked came stumbling out of her room, still clutching her neck. \n \n “ Are you alright ma ’ am? There were reports of screaming. ” \n \n I stood between them: the woman that was finally supposed to be my escape and the security guard that was now looking right through me. The hope was gone. \n \n I slid past the guard as he walked toward the woman. She was babbling incoherently, but I didn ’ t care anymore. It hadn ’ t worked. They had said if I gave away enough of the tainted blood, diluting it into my victims, I could reverse the symptoms. I could become visible again – a normal vampire. Clearly, they had been wrong about how many it would take. \n \n I walked through the hotel lobby, not caring who I bumped into, leaving a stream of confused people saying “ sorry ” to the empty air. I sat in a chair and waited for another solo traveler to come through. Maybe the next one would be enough. \n\n"}
{"prompt": "“ Over here! ” \n \n I looked up from my phone and stopped walking. An old man stood in a doorway at the far end of the hall", "human": "“ Over here! ” \n \n I looked up from my phone and stopped walking. An old man stood in a doorway at the far end of the hall, waving me over with a grime-covered glove. A custodian. I looked behind me, but classes were still in session so there was no one around but the two of us. He had to be talking to me. I really didn ’ t want to have to help him clean a dirty toilet or some kid ’ s vomit. Or maybe he was senile and thought I was a student and was about to tell me off for walking around the school with a phone. \n \n I turned back. “ Sorry, but I ’ ve got a thing— ” \n \n “ Oh that ’ s fine, ” he said. “ You ’ ve got nothing better to do anyway. ” \n \n I blinked. He was right in front of me? Hadn ’ t I stopped walking? No, wait, either way there was no way I could have gotten to the end of the hall that quickly. I was close enough now to read the old man ’ s work-shirt, which declared him to be “ Charles. ” He was grinning at me, like a kid who thought he ’ d just played a prank on me without my realizing it. It was creepy, so I began a hasty retreat. He opened his mouth to speak but I cut him off. \n \n “ Look, I was just about to leave, right after I bring my sister her lunch. ” I held up a bright pink lunch bag with way too many sequins on it. “ Do you know where Ms. Long ’ s classroom is? ” \n \n He nodded vigorously. “ Oh, don ’ t worry, I ’ ll take it to her. Just wait here. ” He reached out and took the lunch bag from me. I blinked. \n \n Then I blinked again because I thought I ’ d gone blind. Behind me, a creak and the old man ’ s footsteps echoing from the hall. I turned just as the door shut, leaving me alone in the dark. I scrambled toward the faint light that slipped between the door and its frame, feeling for the doorknob. I half expected it not to budge, but instead it simply turned loosely, uselessly. Pulling and pushing on the door yielded no results, so I kicked it in frustration and fear. I ’ d just gotten pranked by a crazy old man, trapped in a room I had no recollection of walking into. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I turned to look for something I could break the door with and found myself looking at an arsenal of things to break it with. \n \n Impossible weapons, barely visible in the scant light that made it from the hallway, lined the walls of the room, which itself was impossibly big; the school was a one floor affair, but the Ionian pillars flanking the door must have been as tall as the flagpole outside. On one of the pillars, out of place with the architecture, was a light switch. I flipped it on to get a better look at the weapons on display. \n \n Florescent light brightened the room, and I walked over to the weapon nearest to the entrance, a sword held by a wax-figure arm which protruded from the wall. \n “ Excalibur, ” I breathed. A nearby placard told me the weapon ’ s purpose. “ To rule through might. ” I didn ’ t need it to tell me that. The sword ’ s polished edge bled power while its jewel-studded hilt shone authority. Across the hall, I saw an absurd-looking hammer—really, a rectangular prism of metal with a stick poking out of it to serve as a handle. “ Mjolnir. ” The name sprang into my mind as readily as my own. The placard next to it read, “ To smite a giant. ” \n \n I looked around and was caught by surprise when I found a section of the hall that seemed dedicated entirely to weapons from contemporary culture. Walking past a bucket whose sign read, “ To melt a witch, ” I started to consider firing up Luke ’ s lightsaber and dropping it, tip first. I quickly reached out to open the case before I could convince myself it was a bad idea, but apparently the old man had already reached that conclusion himself. He popped into existence next to me, slapped my wrist, grabbed it, and then pulled me away from all the pop culture weapons. \n \n “ Don ’ t touch that with your oily hands. It doesn ’ t belong to you. Yours is somewhere over here. ” I struggled to match pace with him, feeling certain that he ’ d be happy to actually drag me by the wrist if I didn ’ t keep up. \n \n “ What do you mean? Will I get something like Excalibur, or Mjolnir? ” \n \n “ All those have stories already. You ’ d have to already be a hero or something to get one of those. No, one of the ones back there, ” he said, pointing ahead, “ wants you instead. Lucky you, being the first. ” As we walked further, I stopped recognizing any of the weapons. With the weapons from before, names and legends seared themselves into my mind, telling their stories whether or not I ’ d ever heard of them before. These weapons on the other hand, though impressive in their own right, were silent. Waiting. “ These weapons don ’ t have stories, yet. Perfect for someone like you. ” We stopped in front of an alcove, and I felt my heart jump with excitement. On display in the alcove was a sleek black revolver, lying on a blood-red velvet cushion. The sign read, “ To pay a debt. ” \n \n I shuddered. “ I ’ ve never shot a gun before, but if— ” The old man grabbed me by the shoulders and spun me so that I faced the other way, to the opposite alcove. \n “ That one ’ s yours. ” He grinned. I stepped into the alcove, incredulous. I picked up the weapon. \n \n “ It ’ s a stick. ” It was most certainly not a wand, either. Certainly, it was a very impressive looking stick, half as long again as my arm, and straight and smooth but for two outcroppings near the base, but it was the kind of stick you could find lying on the ground anywhere. I looked for a placard to tell my what was so special about this stick. Finding none, I turned toward the old man, my face a picture of confusion. He smiled. \n \n “ To change a life. ” Without warning, he clapped his hands in my face. I blinked. \n \n I looked around, stick still in hand. I was outside now, in the park behind the school. The old man was nowhere to be seen. A gentle breeze shook the leaves of a large oak tree nearby, the rustling blending with the sniffling of a boy who was hugging his knees with his back against the trunk. He looked to be in second grade, about the same age as my sister. I stood there awkwardly for a bit, wondering if he noticed me appear out of nowhere. It didn ’ t seem so. I stepped toward him, now wondering if he was alright. He started and looked up at the sound of my footsteps. \n \n I stopped and held his gaze for a few seconds. “ Shouldn ’ t you be in school? ” I finally asked. He hugged his knees more tightly. A nod. “ Well, why aren ’ t you? ” He buried his face in his knees again, \n \n “ My friends told me that we couldn ’ t be friends anymore if I stopped letting him have my toys. ” \n \n Oh. “ They don ’ t sound like very good friends, then. ” The words came easily enough; I was a lot like those “ friends ” a long time ago, and regretted it now. His sniffles turned to sobs. \n \n “ They said I ’ m a crybaby. ” \n \n Those words were familiar. “ There ’ s nothing wrong with crying when you ’ re sad. ” Slowly, his sobbing turned into chocked crying. I walked over to the tree and sat down next to him. \n \n For a long while I sat there, tracing the whorls on the stick I ’ d gotten. Now that I looked closer, it vaguely resembled a sword, with the two stubs near the end looking like a cross-guard. I held it by its hilt. Eventually the boy ’ s crying subsided. “ Do you hate them? ” I asked. He shook his head, and I smiled at him. “ Good. I was worried for a second there. ” \n \n “ Why? ” he asked. He looked at the stick in my hands. \n \n “ See this? ” I lifted the stick. “ The truth is that I ’ m a hero. This is my weapon. ” A dubious look. I chuckled. “ It ’ s true. This only looks like a stick. In reality, it ’ s a sword. I use it to defeat bad spirits. I thought one might have possessed you. ” \n \n “ I ’ ve never seen any spirits. ” \n \n “ And it would be weird if you could! ” I said, poking him gently. “ After all, spirits are invisible. The bad ones are tricky and mean, but they aren ’ t very strong. Defeating them is easy, once you know where they are. ” \n \n “ But you can ’ t see them. ” \n \n “ That ’ s why I have a sixth sense. So I can know where they are. ” I jumped up and away from the tree, swinging the stick with a satisfying whoosh. “ Like that one. He was trying to sneak up on us. ” \n \n “ How ’ d you know he was there? ” the boy asked, wiping his face with his sleeves. \n \n “ I told you, I have a sixth sense. ” I shouldered the stick and began stroking my chin. “ Although, I suppose that even if you couldn ’ t see them, you could still defeat them if you had a weapon. ” At that, the boy stood up and walked around, looking at the ground intently. He picked up a large stick, almost as long as he was tall, and showed it to me. \n \n “ Like this? ” \n \n “ Yeah, look at that! It ’ s a sword! ” I swung at the air. This was kinda fun. “ You should practice with it. You never know where the bad spirits might show up next. Better get strong enough to fight. ” He smiled. \n \n “ And one day will I be able to sense them? I want to defeat bad spirits too, and stop them from possessing people. ” \n \n “ Sure, and until you can sense them, just swing your sword around. They ’ re pretty bad at dodging, so I can hit them with my eyes closed. Like this! ” \n \n “ Did you get one? ” \n \n “ Sure did. You try! ” I watched him swipe at the air furiously. “ Nice! You got one! ” \n \n “ I got two! I felt it! They went whoosh and crashed into the tree! ” \n \n “ Really? Well, let ’ s have a contest then. There are a bunch more, and we can see which of us can defeat the most spirits. ” \n \n The boy nodded. “ I ’ ll win for sure, ” he was beaming now. \n \n “ I bet you can, ” I grinned. “ Ready? ” I raised my sword. \n \n The boy slashed the air with his and yelled, “ Go! ” \n\n"}

I was over a hundred years old and my eldest child had died a few nights before. \n \n It was a sign that I had lived long enough. I raised three wonderful children, got to see them all married and have children of their own. I had watched the world turn and change, new inventions, advancements. I had seen the old guard retire and the next generation take up the helm, then retire in turn. I had seen my first great grandchild. \n \n Quite simply; I had lived long enough. There was no point in staying for years longer, lingering while my children and grandchildren died before me. \n \n I walked out into the woods, it was a quiet winter night. I decided to simply let go. So I watched the snowfall as it got colder and colder, as the feeling left my hands and feet and crept upwards from there until I was n't even shivering any more. \n \n It was not a pleasant experience, but the thought of seeing my wife and my friends once more kept a smile on my face. I went to sleep believing I would move on in my dreams. \n \n Instead I met death who told me simply that it was not my time. \n \n Two hundred years have passed. On each anniversary of our first meeting I do the same thing, go to sleep in the cold dead of night to be woken by death itself in the morning. \n \n Each time death tells me the same thing. \n \n `` It is not your time yet master.

The hope that one year it'll tell me that my time has finally come. I hold to hope that it shall be soon. \n \n The one thing they do n't tell you about immortality is how boring it is. And how crushing it is to see your loved one's pass.

The world was dying, slowing in its last breath, but he was not a scavenger. He was not a vulture. \n \n \n He had always wanted to be a doctor. A real doctor like the stories told of. Someone who studied, dedicated their life to the art of making people well. Someone who was a sucker in this dying world. \n \n \n *I can make it better, * he thought. \n \n \n But the world rejoiced in its demise. It was thankful, almost. With the wishes, people would ensure that things were perfect. Wishes were the morphine and all pain was lost in the delirium. The world was dying from abandonment, but it died from euthanasia. \n \n \n He was different though. His wish had been protected by his parents, kept in a trust until he was twenty and responsible enough. But he was near forty now and he had not touched it. He had not taken the easy way out. \n \n \n With his father's unending wealth he traveled the world. He went to Germany in the cold, in the snow and picturesque scenery among the privileged. He went with only his jacket and the promise to maintain the un-uttered wish. He went in search of an old doctor. \n \n \n The man was old, near ninety, and he had wished to live forever. He had been around when the wishes were only memories. He had been among the unlucky generation, that last people who had to struggle for their heart's desire. He went to him, Winston the man was called, and he begged to be taught to be a doctor. \n \n \n `` You are young though,'' old Winston said. `` You have the gift from God.'' \n \n \n `` I still wish to learn the way of old,'' he said. \n \n \n And so he learned. Something foreign to the world, learning and the growing pains of knowledge, he endured it all. The years passed with age and finally he was done. \n \n \n `` There is no school as in my time,'' Winston said. `` But you are a doctor all the same.'' \n \n \n He was glad. He was thankful. He could not have told why he saved his wish, but there was something to just doing it for real, doing it for himself. \n \n \n He had no business of course. The world had grown since the wishes became apparent. It had adapted, fitting itself snugly for its casket. A new profession had emerged that allowed people to word their wish so that they lived forever in paradise. They had worded the wish so as to prove God and bend Him to man's will. \n \n \n He was alone in his human torture. The knowledge of a doctor was wasted and in his time he tried to think ahead. He tried to not use his wish. \n \n \n *Hold still, * he thought. *You are not God. * \n \n \n Then one day the young boy had come. He was an orphan and without guidance. He called himself Bottle for that was all he knew. \n \n \n `` People hate that I am on the bottle,'' he said, but he knew not what that meant. \n \n \n He was a drunk and alone and he had no trust. Bottle had used his wish for food in his desperation and in his youth. He had no conception of what he could have wished for. And he was dying. \n \n \n The cancer had grown and there was not much time. He tried his best but Bottle was not in a good position. He stabilized him but the boy suffered and it was only a question of when, not if, he would die. \n \n \n *I can help, * he thought, but he was educated. \n \n \n He knew the words were folly. He tried his best, he did all he good. Bottle was dying and on the bed he faded in pain that was unimaginable. The world itself was not dying so painfully. \n \n \n `` I am sorry, Bottle,'' he said. \n \n \n `` I have failed as a doctor.'' \n \n \n The boy was unconscious then. In the silence he thought to his teachings and though his heart was heavy, the morals of a doctor guided him, commanded him. In the failing world it meant little, but to him it was everything. \n \n \n He used his wish on Bottle, wording it so the boy would forever live in happiness. In that instant, Bottle awoke, and the boy's face was soft, pleasant and not in pain. \n \n \n The dull feeling of regret haunted him almost as immediately as the words were whispered, but in his heart he knew he had made the right choice. He would be one of the few to die. He would be one of the few who was wish-less, never experiencing that transcendence as only playing God could provide. But he would die proud. And he would die a doctor. The slow euthanasia of the world could continue, but he had achieved some life. He had helped Bottle. He could live with himself. No wish could ever compare.\n"}

BeastSlayer19 was a hardcore adventurer, exploring even the deadliest of dungeons.

It did help that I had a monopoly on the business, being the only shop in the world. \n \n `` Thanks man, I got from a friend. Anyway, I got some sweet items for you this time.'' he says, opening his inventory to reveal a massive pile of loot. The first thing to catch my eye are tons and tons of Fluctuation Crystals in the stash. For him, a warrior, they were useless. Only wizards could take advantage of the rare energy units which contained massive quantities of mana within. \n \n `` Alright, you can have it all...'' he says, rummaging through the pile. \n \n `` Great.

A sword that could completely ignore armor and defensive spells could defeat virtually any boss in a single hit. \n \n `` W-well, h-how about this? I can pay you a special deal this time for those Fluct Crystals, alright? 25,000 a piece. It's a much better than that sword. After all, it's probably some scammer out to steal your Fluct Crystals.

{"prompt": "\n Cam hit the alarm button seconds before the radio station blared out `` Umbrella'' by Rihanna. The mornings were the worst part for Cam,", "human": "\n Cam hit the alarm button seconds before the radio station blared out `` Umbrella'' by Rihanna. The mornings were the worst part for Cam, the loneliness, and repetition. His mother used to say a morning dictated the rest of your day, he'd thought it was the dumbest mantra any parent had passed onto their child; when you added that to his feminine curly eyelashes, jet black hair just to a military safe level and his stick figure body shape- it made her out to be quite a bad parent. Maybe that was why he was stuck in this loop, every day starting out the same and there were n't consequences for anything he did once he went to sleep. If it were n't the reason, the importance of mornings was the only lesson he'd learned from his thousands of days being the same problem. \n \n He sat up, threw the covers off the bed entirely, and began dancing around naked as a newborn. He cha-cha'ed over to the bathroom in the tiny hotel room from the seventies and brushed his teeth. The bathroom was the most modern aspect of the room with a tile counter and a sink that was fake brass colored. The room outside was covered in a pink paisley wall paper and the bed frame was one of those obnoxious wavy metal things with bars like a jail cell. He spat. `` Today... what do I want to do today...'' Cam said to himself as he dabbed the washcloth onto his face. `` Virginia... she's definitely on the list. Mary too, I think it's lunch time that she gets so very wonderfully lonely- then I'll steal a glance at the yoga studio. I have n't been with Betty for a few weeks, and that instructor called me fat weeks ago- he deserves some revenge. And I'll end in the library, just like usual.'' Cam walked out of the bathroom and dressed in the same outfit he'd been wearing for the last three thousand days. It was a cheap button down and khakis. The shirt had pinstripe blue lines and the cufflinks matched the tie clip he'd long since stopped wearing. `` Alright and for the library, I'm reading Great Expectation, page 58, yesterday was page 11 and my last day reading The Last of the Mohicans'' Cam straightened his collar and walked out of the room leaving the door wide open. \n \n Cam strutted about town, calling a few people daring names while handing others the money out of his wallet. He loved that, the karmic exchange of a dollar for a smile. It was made better by the fact that he did n't actually pay the money, at least tomorrow it would be back. Cam walked down three blocks in the tiny town and took a left down a scenic neighborhood. \n \n He never tired of the beauty, that much he had to admit. Even for the thousandth time, the trees lining the perfect American dream neighborhood meshed with the white picket fences and the gardens that surely rivaled Eden's brought a different kind of smile to his face. He was struck with wonder; Cam stepped over a tree root ripping itself free from the concrete without looking. He turned into a yard with a `` For Sale'' sign in the lot. He knocked, Victoria answered. She was a girl unaware of her beauty; she was n't the thinnest but her eyes were a striking blue like the scales of a healthy fish, and her skin was smoother than tanned leather roasting in the sun. Cam followed the script he'd developed, it worked every time; he talked about how sorry he was and told her there would be other fish in the sea and you just had to put yourself out there. He told her about his first lost love and how dearly he missed her- how she looked a bit like Victoria and he just wanted someone to hold him. They were in the bedroom in under a half hour, not his record but close. \n \n Cam left her for coffee, something he'd never bring back, and carried on about his day. He watched the man at the Yoga Studio around two right when the coffee was done clearing him out and allowed him to leave it in the instructor's shoe. He watched from the outside window as the man, alarmed at what he stepped in, tried not to gain anyone's attention. Mary walked out of the door third, holding a green yoga mat. The olive green of the sweat covered mat was the same as her eyes, and that perfect red hair shouted out with excitement and lust. Her husband was never around, she did n't require such a script as Mary. As Cam walked her back to her home, arm in arm, his thoughts flashed back to his mother's words. The morning does make the man, and this morning he had been completely together for the first time- his schedule was working, he was clean, happy, he beat the alarm. It was a flawlessly executed day. \n \n Mary was flawless back in her bedroom; yoga was a fantastic workout for both of them. He forgot all about Betty, she'd been a few places behind Mary at the yoga studio but she was n't quite as fun either. Betty drabbled on about a cat she owned once and how it was reincarnated into the one she had now, Mary at least had some ambition. She was working for the mayor, hoping to take his place during the next term. Cam would vote for her, but there was n't any worry about that. \n \n The pair went out to dinner at the Italian place, he paid not that it mattered much, and left her back at her doorstep. Cam explained all the work he'd have to do this evening what with his role in the parade that started in three days, but he would see her again soon. If she was more observant or suspicious, she's mention that he was walking the wrong way to the school gym, but she was n't. Cam walked back to Victoria's house for one last romp of the evening. \n \n Victoria cried when they were finished, something about the coffee. He did n't care, it would all wash back to the ocean in just a few hours anyway. Cam snuck out with the classic bathroom excuse and made for the library. A block away he realized his shirt was stained with some mystery goo, and he'd left his belt and undershirt at Victoria's. He shrugged, all would be fine tomorrow, especially if it went anything like today. \n \n The library was darker than normal like a storm cloud was overhead blotting out the moon. Cam lined his elbow up with the window pane by the door handle and pulled back. The glass crumbled to the ground; Cam reached inside to twist the handle. He flicked on the lights in the fiction section and ran his hands down the alphabetical markings until he landed on section D. Dickens was the third shelf down on the left side. Cam held the book, they were the only things that kept him sane in a repetitious world like this. He read a book an evening most of the time, it was progressing in something, and it was all on him- no bookmarks, no dog ears no notes to himself- this was the only connection he had. \n \n Cam did n't wake up before the alarm. He woke to the book falling out of his hand and closing tight on his finger. The sun was rising through the giant windows, blotting red through his field of vision. It was a new day, `` shit.''\n"}

How many times are we gon na check him out? ” Foster complained. Turning, Evans fixed his new partner with a look. The other man frowned, then held up a hand. “ Whatever. ” \n \n Evans got out of the car and straightened his jacket and tie before walking around to the front of the building. He didn ’ t care if Foster followed or not. Senior man called the shots, and he ’ d spent too many years shooting where told by *his* seniors to even consider giving up the privilege now that he was in charge. \n \n The bell above the door dinged as he pushed through. As usual, there were no open places at any of the tables packed into the seating area. And a line a dozen people deep snaked along the counter toward the register. \n \n “ Special Agent Evans, ” a small, mousey looking man said as he came through the flap that divided the counter. It thumped behind him against the rubber stoppers, ignored by both men as Evans held his hand out. “ How are you today? ” \n \n “ Frankie, looks like you ’ re doing well. ” \n \n “ Seems so. Still nosing around hoping to catch me being bad? ” \n \n Evans resisted the urge to scowl. “ We both know this is a game you ’ re playing. ” \n \n “ It ’ s no game, ” Frankie said, gesturing around. “ Why do you think they ’ re all coming? ” \n \n “ They don ’ t know you like I do. ” \n \n “ You eat my food too. ” \n \n “ Investigation, not consumption. ” \n \n Frankie grinned like a little kid. “ But you still keep eating it, yeah? ” \n \n “ Yeah Frankie, I eat the food, ” Evans admitted reluctantly. \n \n “ For you, I ’ ll make something special. You still like sausage and peppers? ” \n \n “ I ’ ve only got half an hour. And it doesn ’ t look like there ’ s anywhere to sit. ” \n \n “ Don ’ t worry about that, ” Frankie said dismissively. He turned and gestured toward a guy, almost a kid judging by the patchiness of his beard, who was approaching the counter flap with an empty bus tub. “ Johnny, when a table opens up, put my good friend here at it. Him and his partner. ” \n \n “ Sure thing Mr. Butler. ” \n \n Evans watched as Frankie lifted the counter flap so Johnny could pass through, then went into the kitchen and nudged his way in between a couple of other employees at one of the prep counter. His expression was professional, but inwardly he was starting to wonder. Three months now, and for the last two it had been like this every day. The first month had been while word of mouth spread through the surrounding blocks, and now there were even people starting to come from further afield. \n \n If it was a prank, or a cover, it was among the best he ’ d ever heard of. And he ’ d heard of a lot. Including the travel agency that had operated for nearly five years and even won awards for customer service and industry excellence … all while bringing powder and bricks back on every flight. This though … the only reason he didn ’ t have a full surveillance op running was he couldn ’ t convince his SAC what the exact angle was. It had taken him calling in a couple of favors to even have some taps set up to watch the pizzeria ’ s bank accounts for unusual activity. \n \n Which there wasn ’ t. Everything was completely aboveboard as far as anyone could tell. \n \n But he knew. He just *knew* this was a sham. \n \n “ Agent Evans? ” \n \n Turning, Evans saw Johnny wiping down an empty table with a cloth. He threaded his way through the other patrons, busy scarfing down slices and pies, and sat down. \n \n “ You want coffee? Or is today a Pepsi day for you? ” \n \n Evans frowned very slightly at Johnny, searching the kid ’ s expression for any sign of humor. But he just looked ready to take the order. Frankie didn ’ t offer waitresses, and Johnny was only the bus boy. But Evans was in a special category. “ Coffee, ” he said. \n \n “ Make that two, ” Foster said, dropping into the other chair. The tables were small; to discourage loitering as much as to provide the maximum amount of eatery real estate. \n \n “ Two coffees, ” Johnny said, picking up his bus tub and heading for the front counter. \n \n Evans ignored Foster, who responded by pretending to be interested in looking through notes from the morning ’ s interviews on his phone. While his junior played the polite and respectful card semi-decently, Evans looked around. Trying to place the faces he saw. Some were regulars, but that wasn ’ t unusual. \n \n Every restaurant in the city, hell every *food cart* in the city, had regulars or they ’ d be closed. He ’ d run license plates, he ’ d run credit card numbers gathered from shoulder surfing, he ’ d run names garnered from some casual interviews in the first week, and every single one was legit. Perfectly ordinary New Yorkers. \n \n A couple with minor criminal incidents in their past, one guy who ’ d done ten years for aggravated assault, and another who had actually been busted for drug running; but no one seemed active. They were all clean, reformed citizens now. And the rest had apparently *always* been normal. \n \n Every employee was clean, to a man and woman. Nothing worse than parking and speeding tickets. Not even any DUIs. None of them with any citizen or immigration or tax troubles. He was certain Frankie had hired a completely clean staff for his benefit. Which was the right move if Frankie actually was serious about this pizza thing; Evans would have jumped on any excuse to come down on him. \n \n Coffee was there in less than a minute, and Frankie was back in ten. He brought a small pizza scattered with crumbled sausage, sliced red and yellow peppers, and a generous helping of extras. Chopped basil leaves, some finely diced mushroom, and what he suspected was a bit of spinach. “ Here you go fellas, ” he said, sliding the pan into the middle of the table and wedging a pair of white paper plates in on the corners near each man. \n \n “ That smells amazing, ” Foster said, reaching immediately for a slice. He yanked it off and onto his plate in one quick motion, then sucked quickly on his fingers to cool them off. “ Hot though. ” He accepted the napkins Frankie offered him, wiping the hot grease off. \n \n “ Frankie, you know my offer ’ s still open, ” Evans said. “ But if you keep wasting my time like this, I ’ ll rescind it. ” \n \n “ There ’ s nothing to find because I ’ ve got nothing to hide, ” Frankie said with a shrug. “ Just what you see. You ’ re welcome to look through the kitchen and store rooms again. ” \n \n “ No one walks away from the Bonannos to start a pizzeria. ” \n \n “ That ’ s the past. You ’ ve got nothing on me, because I ’ m not doing anything. This is my future. ” \n \n “ Bullshit. ” \n \n Frankie finally frowned. “ Special Agent Evans. I have customers. Language, please. ” \n \n “ Frankie, I can protect you. If you ’ re serious about this, ” Evans said, waving his hand at the pan on the table, “ then I ’ ll make sure the Marshals set you up with a joint wherever they settle you down. You can cook all you want. After you testify. ” \n \n “ I don ’ t need protection, because I ’ m not running. So there ’ s no need to hide. New York ’ s my town, and I ’ m not leaving. ” \n \n “ Frankie— ” \n \n The small man shook his head. “ I like you Evans, but don ’ t push me. I ’ d hate to have start filing harassment complaints. Enjoy the pie. ” \n \n Evans watched as Frankie made his way back to the kitchen, stopping several times to shake hands and ask other diners how they liked their lunches. \n \n “ There ’ s no way that guy is playing you, ” Foster said. \n \n Turning, Evans fixed the rookie with a sharp look. For once, Foster didn ’ t shrink from the steely-eyed gaze the veteran agent shot at him. He just folded the slice he ’ d pulled off to his plate lengthwise and took a bite, returning Evans ’ study with a calm expression. \n \n “ What, with your six months of experience, makes you say that? ” \n \n “ No one who can make a slice this good is hiding anything except the recipe for the sauce, ” Foster shrugged. “ And that ’ s the one question he won ’ t answer, right? ” \n \n “ Shut up, ” Evans said, reaching for a slice of his own. \n\n"}

Five hours ago the infamous terrorist cell, Dragon ’ s", "human": "Dr. Probability sat handcuffed in a holding cell in Diamond City ’ s central police station. Five hours ago the infamous terrorist cell, Dragon ’ s Bane, attempted to pull off a series of attacks that would have taken thousands of lives and left the city in shambles. Dr. Probability called in the threat and based off his ability was able to direct authorities to the probable locations the Dragon ’ s Bane would strike. As always he was right. A few of the terrorists deviated from their plans and some were able to do damage before taken down. In all 47 were injured, and 1 was killed. Though the city sends their best support to those grieving families, many are grateful nothing worse came to city of nearly half a million. \n \n When Dr. Probability entered the police cruiser, he was being taken once again to city hall to shake hands with the mayor. Except this time when he arrived downtown, he was arrested under probable cause he knew of the attack and maybe even had a hand in orchestrating it. \n \n “ How did you know there was going to be an attack?!?! ” Detective Reeves yelled slamming his fists on the table “ Tell me know! ” Dr. Probability looked the detective in the eyes. “ Last week DB made a threat against our nation. Given our mayor ’ s recent speech condemning Dragon ’ s Bane, there was a probability of 33 in 40 that we would be the next target. I then went to our Herbert Park and waited for signs of an impending attack. This afternoon I saw a van pull up and explosives being subtly unloaded. I then called the authorities and advised of the other probable locations. ” “ Bullshit! ” Detective Reeves exclaimed, “ After every catastrophic event. You are always there at the center of all. The whole city thinks you ’ re a hero. ” Detective Reeves took a mocking tone, “ There is a 1 in 3 chance that this bank will be robbed at noon, there is a 4 in 9 chance the chief of police is having an affair, ” the detective began reverting back to his angry tone “ there is a 87 in 88 chance I have been bullshitting you all! The other officers might eat your shit all day, but I DON ’ T BUY IT!!! ” The detective slammed his fists against the metal desk again. \n \n Dr. Probability was unfazed by the detective ’ s tone. People often get angry at things that they do not understand. “ You are a detective correct? What would I have to gain if what you claim is true? ” Detective Reeves took the chair across the table. “ Oh I don ’ t know. Book deals, money, fame, glory, woman, power! ” Dr. Probability sighed “ But do I have any of those things? I mean, a college professor and statistician, which statistically pays better than the average salary. But in world of mega celebrities and billion dollar companies, I am much closer to the average person. Fame, sure, but it is usually followed by a joke or snarky remark. Glory, don ’ t make laugh, most of the world labels me as a freak and my peers label me as a fraud. Woman, another laughable idea, I ’ m nearly 65 years old and I ’ ve never married. I can ’ t even remember the last time I went on a date. And to your last point power. ” Dr. Probability stopped talking and lifted up his arms that were now handcuffed. Reeves had been so sure, he had rehearsed this speech a thousand times for his supervisors, for his peers, and in his mirror. However now he stood across the table from the man he accused of all these disasters and he saw that he couldn ’ t possible be the cause of it all. \n \n “ How did you know the locations? ” The detective asked looking disappointedly at the one way mirror. Dr. Probability perked back up “ Well. Herbert Park is our largest public space and would no doubt be their priority target. I counted 15 from the Dragon ’ s clan, which would put their numbers between 100-145. Then I went through a list in my head of large public spaces that had high foot traffic that had ease of access with little security. After that it was simple statistics. ” The detective opened the folder and started going through a list of standard questions. “ After spotting the terrorists how long was it until you called authorities. ” There was a silence after that question. The detective looked up and saw what looked like Dr. Probability counting in his head. “ I called after 1 minute and 13 seconds from seeing them pull up in their black truck. ” The detective looked up, “ When you called you gave dispatch all the location the locations they would strike. ” Dr. Probability nodded “ Yes indeed! That took me three seconds to calculate. ” \n \n The detective closed the folder. “ But you didn ’ t save everyone. ” Dr. Probability frowned and looked down. “ No sadly in the terrorists attempt to escape or carry out their mission they injured 47 and took 1 life. But it could have been worse much worse. A city of 437,769, to only have 48 lives immediately affected is pretty good I think. ” The detective was now watery in his eyes, Dr. Probability did not notice. “ Just 48? What about those who knew the victims. ” Dr. Probability put his hand on his chin. “ Ah yes. 48 people, each probably had a circle of friends and family of about 60. 2880 lives affected by the tragedy. Still on the grand scheme of things, life should resume back to equilibrium of normality in the next 17 hours. ” The detective got angry again “ 17 hours!?!? That ’ s how long it will take people to get over this. ” Just then another officer came into the room. “ Well that of course is an average. Some were not even emotionally affected where for others it could take years to recover from this afternoon ’ s events. ” \n \n The other detective grabbed Detective Reeves and moved him towards the door. The other officer spoke next. “ Alright Mark, you have a had long day. Let ’ s take some time… ” Dr. Probability stood up and interrupted the other officer. “ Excuse me. What was the name of the woman that lost her life this afternoon? ” The other detective spoke again “ Susan Reeves. ” Dr. Probability sighed. “ I see Detective Reeves ’ s wife. ” Dr. Probability looked at the detective. “ Detective Reeves I ’ m assuming that is your wife. I ’ m sorry she is no longer with us. I ’ m sure she was a great woman and she will be missed, but due to an unforeseen series of events she was taken from us. Though yes, I use my power to prevent many lives from being lost, I am not able to save everyone. ” Detective Reeves turned back around with dried tears in his eyes and unlocked Dr. Probability ’ s handcuffs. “ You are right. Even though you do your best, this world is unpredictable. You shouldn ’ t be held guilty for that what you can ’ t predict. ” \n\n"}

Read it, my father told me. Understand it. Come to us with questions. But ultimately, the choice is yours. \n \n I ’ d known of the book ’ s existence, but since I was an only child, it had never been an issue in the house before now. \n \n The book was my dad ’ s copy. It was dog-eared and, as I leafed through it, I saw his handwritten notes. I ran up to my room to dive into *The Eternal and the Dead. * \n \n The first few chapters were a real bore. It detailed the scientific breakthroughs long ago that discovered immortality - how a few genetic compounds found only in newborns can be modified and applied to a human body near its growth maturation stage to ‘ turn-off ’ the effects of aging. \n \n The book spelled out the Choice. Those who sought eternity must obtain the newborn ’ s genetic material. The infant stripped of these essential building blocks would never reach full maturity and are granted the mercy of death before they reach the ‘ age of comprehension. ’ \n \n There are those who have made the choice and they are known as Eternalists or Immortalists. Those who decline the choice are Mortalists. Each faction was was granted space in the book to present their case. \n \n The Eternalist portions of the book were thrilling. They talked about the wonders of the universe and what can be learned and experienced in the span of a forever life. The chapters that detailed obtaining the ‘ Sprout of Eternity ’ or the ‘ Fountain ’ ( they never used the terms baby or infant, I noticed ), read like the best spy novels: how to outwit cunning nursery security and tales of eternal friendships and loves that grew from a pack of Eternalists who bonded to obtain a ‘ Gift. ’ \n \n The Mortalists wrote of morality and how no life should be sacrificed for another. They gave impassioned pleas for the order of the universe, how humans were born to die as are all other living creatures. They promised the rewards of an ‘ afterlife. ’ \n \n The book concludes with a warning - the choice must be made before the body reaches its maturation, around age 18. But since bodies age differently some 17-year-olds have tried to apply the treatment and found it to be too late while some have had successful immortality therapy into their early 20s. \n \n Some time after I ’ d read and re-read *The Eternal and the Dead, * I took my dad up on his offer about answering some questions. I asked him what choice he and mom had made; they had never told me. He explained that he was ‘ agnostic ’ when it came to the Choice. I didn ’ t know the term when he spoke it and now I ’ m not sure it ’ s the right word. \n \n My dad explained that he and mom made a pact not to disclose to anyone their decision. Either I would watch them age and die or they would retain the same appearance they now have. Perhaps, my dad said, they would watch me grow old and die. He maintained that the choice was mine and would not speak more about his choice. \n \n I put the book away after that and did not look at it again for some time. Just before I turned seventeen, I re-read again *The Eternal and the Dead. * I contemplated the Immortalists and their thrilling ‘ Fountain ’ chases. I certainly could think of some girls I would join in an immortality pact. I also thought long about the thousands upon thousands of years where humans experienced the life cycles of birth and death and if that was the way it was meant to be. \n \n What was certain was if I didn ’ t make the choice very soon, my body would make it for me. \n \n As I read again the final chapter of the book about the warning of being too old and losing the opportunity for immortality, I noticed a handwritten note I ’ d not seen when I ’ d read the book three years earlier. It was written in a script barely large enough for legibility and easily missed in the page margin. \n \n The words were in the hand of my mother, ‘ Choose well, my son, your brothers did not. ’\n"}

Minutes later, the diver arose. \n \n Immediately after getting on board, he pulled off his water-proof mittens and helmet, indulging himself in the grilled sandwiches and chocolate muffins the fisherman had brought for him.'mmmm, yeah yeah! This is the stuff!' \n \n The fisherman had no care whether the sandwiches and muffins his wife had made were indeed'the stuff'. He was genuinely worried for the diver.'Holy diver! You've been down far too long in the midnight sea! What is becoming of thee?' \n \n To this, the diver told the fisherman one of his famous sayings,'Do not fight what life has planned for you, just ride the tiger. You can see the stripes, but you will know it is clean for ride has intended you to ride it. Man, do n't you see what I mean?' \n \n'Rubbish, Holy Diver!, You have got to get away from this sea! Holy Diver! Are you listening to me?' \n \n'Ahhhh-aaahhh-ahhh, yeah, yeah. Sure.

After constant struggle, months of battling it, he could no longer contain it. It was itching to break out, to explode into the world. Nothing could prepare everyone for what was next. \n \n If you're lost, the best way to explain this is from the beginning. \n \n David was a nice boy from Brooklyn who enjoyed normal 80's activities for 10 year old boys of which I know none of, maybe playing with slinky's or riding penny boards, or wearing tiny shorts or something. Anyways he loved being a kid, until one fateful day he was abducted in the middle of the night. To his avail this was n't an ordinary abduction, yes that day David was abducted by the gods of rock. He had previously listened to some Beatles and other popular rock artists of the past decades but music was something David ultimately dismissed as he frolicked through the 1980's doing 1980's things. \n \n After this night everything changed for David Draiman of Disturbed. \n \n David moved from city to city after that and began tuning out the observant Jewish tradition and tuning in his heavy guitar based music. He began `` rebelling against comformity'' to become a `` normal teenage kid'' started his own band in the different cities including L.A. and Milwaukee, and began practicing the religion of rock first and Judaism second. His parents were furious at times, but David was set to complete the voyage the rock gods sent him on all those years before. The 80's came and went, and all of his idols were becoming irrelevant as well. This sprung in the age of Heavy Metal. The first Metallica song David heard actually made him convulse due to the prolific nature and beauty of the intense rhythmic chords. The vocals, guitar, bass, and drums all created a wondrous symphony that David could not turn his ear from. \n \n Over the following decade acts such as Nirvana, Sublime, and Red Hot Chili Peppers emerged as top contenders with hit singles and albums that inspired David Draiman to link up with a struggling band called Disturbed in 1996 after they had a falling out with their lead signer. \n \n His destiny was almost complete, and rock gods sat there all this time patiently watching as he David scaled, nearing the top of the Rock Olympus. \n \n It was then that they gave him the final gift. \n \n David, did not know what was happening to him. He did not feel right. \n \n He tried to fight it but his condition worsened and he did not know what to do to relieve himself of his ailment. \n \n He was a medical mystery, stricken and cursed he was inflicted with the most awful of pains to ever touch. \n \n He tried turning to music but any song he played would not play correctly. \n \n A few chords sounded okay and with very specific patterns as well. \n \n It was at this point he knew that he was being tested by the rock gods. \n \n `` After constant struggle, months of battling it, he could no longer contain it. It was itching to break out, to explode into the world. Nothing could prepare everyone for what was next.'' \n \n He did n't know what it it was and yelled to the skies, \n \n `` WHAT IS THIS SICKNESS!'' \n \n The skies thundered and clapped and struck a field near David Draiman's home near where had an amp and series of extension cables and microphones set up. The moon lit up this piece of Earth only, so David grabbed his Fender and set for the spotlight of the gods. \n \n He played those chords he played all those months prior and knew what the sickness was. He knew all he had to do was embrace it and so would everyone else. People came, and surrounded as played a mild intro. Slowly the other Disturbed band members joined and knew what to play as well. \n \n He asked the crowd if they could feel it as well as he described the reasons why they should stop resisting. \n \n Then all fell quiet as David prepared and yelled as everyone embraced it just as the gods planned over 20 years before now sitting in the heavens above proud as they watch they're disciple accomplish what dreamed of. \n \n Then David came on the mic and the reverb took over the world. \n \n \n `` GET UP, COME ON GET DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS!'' \n \n \n \n Fin. \n \n [ Get Down With The Sickness by Disturbed ] ( http: //youtu.be/09LTT0xwdfw )\n"}

These societies have long been planning to conquer the world and the time is finally here. \n A ancient society that worshipped poseidon, long ago decided if they just raised the water levels it would destroy a large portion of the farmland, and make the lands smaller, making them easier to control, they had set up their own farm land, and had secured the majority of the land inland. And so they were ready, they began melting enormous glaciers, and icebergs the sizes of citys, this was done simultaneously all over the world. \n \n Meanwhile, another society not as ancient as the previous society but old none the less, were about to enact their plane, realizing that we all depend on the ocean, and if the oceans water level was to drop, it would displace many wetlands, and coastal citys, and cut off the food supply for fishing villages. So they began freezing and turning large portions of the worlds oceams into icebergs and glaciers, through a chemical process, a technique they have kept hidden, they could accomplish quickly. \n \n Another society not very old, a few hundred years at the most, was ready to enact their plan for world conquest, they were going to heat the earth, if they raised the temperture of earth it would wipe out a large portion, and only the ones that took to living underground will survive. They had been living underground since the early 1900s. They began destroying the earths ozone, not like we see in todays global warming but in tearing several large holes, quickly. They did this with technology that identified the type of sub atomic particals made of the ozone, by altering there compostion the would render that section of ozone usless. \n \n All the while a new society only ten years old, was about to enact their plan, they were going to bring about an ice age, by creating a super dense ozone by making the atoms less spread out they would make it so the earth is unable to take in any new heat, it would quickly drop in temperature, and they would probably die too, they didnt really think it through. \n \n And so because of the actions of these societies, the earth became much more habitable, their were now regions in antarctic and the polar caps, that were warm, and could sustain farming. Deserts not had regions of cold climates that allowed for more vegetation growth. \n \n The world became more diverse in climate, and so people were able to know move to regions they were never before able. \n \n And the ocean became far more diverse, as now regions of the atlanric and Pacific were now similar to the arctic and vise versa.

Every time. \n \n My brain remembered each day. I don ’ t know how, even with all of the unexplainable, unbelievable, unintelligible shit I lived through for 11 years, I still maintain that the brain is a physical thing. Memories are imperfectly encoded events that, while not understood, are a combo of biological, chemical, and electrical. Physical things. Able to be touched and measured, just like one's blood pressure, or neurotransmitters released to trigger hunger or anxiety. I do n't know why I remembered each day in the loop – the rest of my body regenerated like new. Wounds healed, bones mended, teeth regrew. Sometimes I would sleep just to repair my body, like a video game. Maybe it was video game, or maybe Descartes was right all along and the mind is separated from the body. Maybe what they tell me is true and I fucked myself up too much. Broke my mind. Because the other option is impossible, isn ’ t it? \n \n I got stuck in what I call the loop on September 14, 2014 A.D. You know the Groundhog ’ s Day? It was the movie Groundhog ’ s Day. Except if you really have this ability, this…. opportunity.... the world isn ’ t PG. \n \n You do some weird stuff when you ’ re the only one who remembers the world and your damage is erased each night. Sometimes you ’ re malicious. Sometimes deviant. Sometimes, after you ’ re in for a while, both. You, reading this, you ’ ve thought of what you would do if time stopped? Imagine what you would do if it just restarted? And you could do anything without repercussion? And you never thought it would end? You don ’ t have to tell me. You know. Some of you would probably be worse than me. \n \n The last 4 years were drugs. Just drugs. Heroin was my favorite. You know how they say the first time high is the best? It ’ s true. I remembered each loop day previous, but every morning I ’ d awake with a fresh brain, full of memories of ecstatic bliss but physically naïve to the drug. Unfamiliar with the chemicals overpowering my natural opioid system with unadulterated pleasure for the first time. Every goddamn beautiful first time. \n \n I ’ ve had a first time high hundreds of times, and I have hundreds of subsequent non-first times more since the loop stopped. Once you find it the first time in the loop, which can be hard, depending on where you ’ re coming from, it ’ s easy to go straight there every day. To say the same things and, because you restart with a full bank account every time, spend all you fucking want. Do all you fucking want. First time. Every time. \n \n That last night in the loop, I pushed it. I thought this was permanent. Whatever trip, whatever end of life DMT-induced hallucination, whatever test or purgatory, computer simulation, whatever the fuck it was. It was the one consistent thing. Each morning I woke up with a fresh mind and a fresh body to abuse. I pushed it. I wanted to push it. I gave my dealer my neighbors car that I stole after hitting him with a bat and tying him to a chair an hour previous, like every other day since I learned he overvalued BMWs as a status symbol and would give me almost any amount I wanted if I pretended it was mine and I was desperate. Dealers are used to desperate people logic. I told him to keep injecting me. I told him I wanted him to try to almost kill me, basically. I knew I wouldn ’ t die. He accepted my death wish and my stolen car. It was to be my last day in the loop. September 14, 2014. \n \n I woke up in the hospital on September 21, 2014, emerging from a medically-induced coma in treatment of an overdose on September 14, 2014. The chart says so. The doctors say so. My parents and sister said so. Apparently, it wasn ’ t just heroin, and I was lucky to survive at all. I would never regain full brain function, but I remember it all. I remember it all fine. \n \n The doctors said that I “ broke ” a part of my brain from being the coma for too long, and being oxygen deprived from asphyxiating on my own vomit before the paramedics could revive me. They say that my memories are the remaining scraps of my brain trying to put together a picture, an explanation for this. I speak more slowly now, but I remember. When I was charged with the legal terms for beating the shit out of my neighbor and stealing his car, I remembered doing it. It was brazen – why not if he wouldn ’ t remember the next day? But this time, he remembered it, too. The court liked his memory and reasoning better. \n \n I know the loop was real. It has to be real – to have at least been real. I know things I could n't have known before the loop. I experienced things that I couldn ’ t have experienced, that the time did not even exist for. I ’ ve learned things – skills, studies, information about people that I only acquired because of the infinite time for trial and error to get further and further each time. I tell the psych evaluator this, I told my lawyers this, and I tell my family this. They react with a mix of dismissiveness and pity. My sister won ’ t talk with me anymore until I “ get clean. ” She doesn ’ t understand, and I pity her for it back. \n \n Each time I use it's not the same. It ’ s not the same and I try harder because I remember. I remember that first highs, all of them pushed together into 4 years of consequence free nirvana. I am chasing something that I ’ ll never hit, something I lived but can ’ t ever return. I yearn for the loop. It aches. I just need the fucking time. \n\n"}

His shoes clicked on the linoleum floor of the Intensive Care ward as he walked past the beds filled with dying old men and women. \n \n He carried his cane in his hand as he walked, and none of the patients paid him any mind, except one old Hatian woman near the end of the row who met his husky-blue eyes with her own and began to yell and scream and press the button for the nurse.

He did n't know where he had gotten his sickness: from a needle maybe, or an unscrupulous partner, but it did n't matter much now. The young mans name was Carlos, named by his mother, who had come from mexico, and worked cleaning the homes of the rich every day on the Upper East Side of New york, from the time she arrived in this new and terrible country to the day that she came home to where Carlos had been playing in front of the TV, sat down heavily in the beat up old leather chair that she favored, and passed out of this life. \n \n Carlos, who had been only six years old then, had looked up to see the strange pale man standing over his mother. He had n't been scared, just curious, as he watched the man, whose age was hard to tell, lay a soft kiss on his mothers forehead, and then carefully smooth her ruffled sleek black hair. \n \n Then the police had come, and an ambulance, and a seemingly endless succession of concerned neighbors and devastated relatives and Carlos had never seen the strange white man again, except for one other night when, sitting outside the Columbia dorms on 125th at 2 in the morning waiting for the boy who would eventually break his heart, Carlos had seen a black cadillac skid through an intersection and barrel through a tiny asian girl who was crossing the street. The strange white man had walked out into the middle of the street where the girl lay, as the cadillac careened off drunkenly into the night, and crouched down to to close her eyes, and stayed with her till the ambulance came. \n \n Now the pale man stood at the foot of Carlos's bed, and their eyes met. \n \n Will it hurt, asked Carlos \n \n Less than it hurts now, said the man. \n \n Carlos nodded. Good. \n \n I've seen you before, Carlos told the old man. I know who you are. \n \n The old man nodded slightly, like a chessmaster whose pawn has been taken. \n \n What comes next?

{"prompt": "Jake rolled over and hit snooze on his phone's alarm for the second time. He only allowed himself three snoozes on any given morning,", "human": "Jake rolled over and hit snooze on his phone's alarm for the second time. He only allowed himself three snoozes on any given morning, but had already decided that he was getting up when it went off again. \n \n He knew that for most people their birthdays were exciting, but he had been dreading his for the past month. Like it or not, today was the day. \n \n The alarm went off again and Jake dragged himself from his warm, soft bed. He stared briefly into the mirror on his closet door and sighed. His features had n't changed. He still did n't need to shave more than once a week. His body was toned and athletic, but in a high school athlete way. Not a wisp of chest hair, much less back hair. He was thankful for the armpit hair he had. That in and of it self was a pretty odd thought. \n \n As he shuffled to the shower his mind took the familiar frustrating trip. How was it that he looked like he was still waiting to graduate high school when all of his peers looked their age? More than looking young, the most frustrating thing was that nobody else seemed to notice until they looked at a photo. \n \n Two years ago he had been engaged to a woman two years younger than himself. That ended abruptly when she saw their engagement photos. She had n't told him, but the grapevine had reported that she felt like a child molester when she saw the pictures of them together. \n \n Since then he had n't really dated. Because his youthful appearance was so prominently on display in photographs, online dating was out. He tried Tinder using `` always swipe right'' method, but all of his matches were 18 to 20 year olds. Sure he could have just had some fun, but that is n't where his mind was at. \n \n As he showered he went ahead and ran a a razor over his upper lip. Being almost completely unable to grow facial hair was bad, growing a dirtstache would have been worse. \n \n Jake quickly toweled off and dressed. He did n't feel the need to do anything to his hair, more over he did n't feel like spending time looking in the mirror. Then he took the thirty second commute to his home office. \n \n As annoying as it might be to be young looking, at least he did n't work in an office any longer. Getting mistaken for an intern got old really quickly. For the past four years he'd worked from home and had noticed a remarkable change in the way he was treated by his co-workers. While they knew what he looked like, without that reminder on a day to day basis they treated him more like the subject matter expert he was. Hopefully this would work in his favor when the time came for a promotion too. \n \n His emails were the same boring things. Questions he could answer in his sleep, though most often he just copied and pasted the answers from a knowledge base document he'd created just for this purpose. The only out of place email was a meeting request for 8am. \n \n `` Who the hell schedules a meeting for 8am?'' Jake said to the empty room. \n \n Fifteen minute. Damnit. Jake started to finding the powerpoint slides that he thought would answer the questions this `` Director of Compliance'' was going to ask. When he was done with that he logged into the Skype call and continued to work while he waited. \n \n Soon he heard the telltale tone that announced the other party had joined the call. Out of the corner of his eye he caught movement on the screen. \n \n `` Shit, a video call. Figures.'' Jake thought as he turned a little wearily towards that screen. A girl who appeared to be in her late teens maybe early twenties was on the screen. \n \n They looked at each other quizzically until Jake asked, `` Are you the Director of Compliance?'' \n \n She nodded slowly and asked, `` Are you the Senior Security Architect?'' \n \n Jake mumbled a `` Yep'' as he stared blankly at the monitor. \n \n After a moment the woman on the other end of the camera said, `` I think we need to have this meeting in person''. \n \n Just like that the call was disconnected and Jake sat staring at his monitor where the Skype call had been a moment before. He swiveled in his chair and opened a tab in his browser. Once on the company's intranet he looked up the Director of Compliance. \n \n She had started at the company six months before he had and had been with the company for seven years. She was a graduate of Yale with an MBA in Regulatory Compliance from Harvard. Jake was still thrashing through the information trying to justify what he'd seen from what he was reading, when his new email notification chimed. It was a new meeting request from Nancy Wright Director of Compliance for 6pm that night. \n \n `` What the hell?'' Jake said aloud. \n \n He clicked on the `` Propose New Time'' icon and wrote a brief note that it was his birthday and he was planning to go out with some friends. Then he suggested the next day. Less than thirty seconds later his Instant Messenger popped up with `` Cancel it and pick me up at the airport at 5:30''. \n \n Now Jake was starting to get pissed. This woman was ordering him around like he was an intern. The last thing he was willing to do was let someone not even a full rung above him on an org chart boss him around on his birthday. He started to furiously type out a reply on to her IM when it chimed again. \n \n `` I'm sorry for that last message, please do this for me. I'll explain tonight.'' \n \n Jake's hands hovered over his keyboard for a minute before he held down the backspace key to wipeout everything he'd typed, then responded with a simple `` OK''. \n \n He pulled up his email and set an out of office status for the rest of the day, then sent an email to his team assigning some tasks and informing them of his status. \n \n This was n't even remotely how he had planned to spend his birthday, but he figured if he was going to lose his evening then he should go have some fun during the day. \n \n Jake changed into shorts and a jersey, put on his well worn pair of 5-10 shoes and went to the garage. He went through the ritual of pulling out his mountain bike checking the tire pressure, shock pressure, chain tension and axles. Then headed out for a ride. \n \n Jake had never found a better way to clear his head than to ride up into the mountains. The climbs had his lungs and legs burning until he was almost ready to give up, then he got the payoff of the decent. \n \n He pedaled towards Corner Canyon, pushing himself harder than usual. Using the time to think through what had happened and wondering about the meeting to come. By the time he found himself at the top of Peak View, he had come to a few conclusions. \n \n First and foremost, Nancy was like him. In as much as she was well older than she looked. He did n't know how much of that was due to the miracle of photography/videography or if she always looked young. \n \n The second thing he was sure of was that she had recognized that about him as well. He thought that she had recognized it much more directly astutely about him than he had with her. \n \n Lastly and by far the most interesting, was that her recognition of his being similar in affliction to her had shocked her into some sort of resolve. How else could he explain her suddenly ending the call and getting a flight from New York to Utah? There was no way she was going to expense a last minute flight to the company. If you did n't schedule your flights three days in advance you had to have VP approval and Jake did n't see how she could have gotten that. \n \n As Jake started down Rush he wondered, `` Why? What's her motivation?'' There were no easy answers here and Jake let his mind go from morbid to erotic as he glided down the trail. By the time he reached the bottom he had come to the conclusion that if she wanted to chop his head off a la Highlander, then she would n't have telegraphed her move. On the other hand, if she wanted to screw his brains out she probably would have acted with more tact and been less demanding. So the two ends of the spectrum were out of bounds and the truth was somewhere in the vast gray in between. \n \n Jake rode home at a leisurely pace. He had plenty of time before he needed to leave for the airport and was enjoying the perfect weather. He told himself that even if her coming into tow turned out to be a bust, at least it had taken his mind off his own issues for a day. \n \n By the time 5 o'clock rolled around Jake was showered and dressed in jeans and a polo shirt. Nancy had sent him an email with her flight information on it while he was out riding, so he used the Flight Tracker app on his phone to confirm it was on time before he climbed in his car and headed to the airport. Since he had only seen her once, and very briefly then, he decided to park his car and head into the terminal where he could watch the arriving passengers stream into the baggage claim area. \n \n The questions returned to his mind making him second guess the whole situation. The one question that kept coming to the front was, would he even recognize her? \n \n The board now showed that her plane had landed and he stared down each person coming through security trying to determine which one was Nancy. It was pretty easy to rule out the men, but he took enough time with each woman that he was sure he'd creeped out a couple of them. If she had the same condition as him, then she might appear years older when not on camera. He could n't even remember what color her hair was. \n \n As the crowd coming through security started to slow and then trickle he became convinced that he had missed her. He started to widen his search, looking around the baggage terminal. \n \n As he scanned back to the security exit a petite woman who looked like she was in her early 20s was walking directly towards him with purpose. She was maybe 5'4'' with strawberry blonde hair and an athletic build, but her eyes, her piercing grey eyes, were fixed on James like hunter approaching its prey. \n \n As she reached him she put her hands on his shoulders, then moved them to his cheeks and stared deep into his eyes. \n \n Suddenly she said, `` We need to talk.'' \n \n If you'd like more I'll continue, but I'm almost at max letters for this post.\n"}

Seldom an issue was important enough that immediate action was required. So if immediate action was important, it usually meant shit was about to, or already had, hit the fan. \n \n The following is a shortened transcript of such a session, a joint meeting, necessary to discuss the aftermath of the proverbial feces hitting something that was much less a fan than it was a turbine. \n \n -- - \n \n > Friday, April 13, 2018 \n > \n > U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, joint with the United States National Security Council. \n > \n > The committees met, pursuant to call, at 14:28, in \n > Room 108, Theodor L.

Due to the nature of this meeting and the implications to the security of our nation, I will make time for a quick recap of the situation: \n > Three days ago, Tuesday April 10, the self-proclaimed anti-militaristic peace activist John Sullivan managed to trick a dangerous goods transport to keep their charge unattended for a moment. Members of Sullivan's activist group then used this opportunity created by him to remove the hazardous material transported, fill it into containers of their own, and escape with it. \n > The material in question was Sarin. \n > \n > [ The chairman reprimands several congressmen for their shouts of disbelieve and refusal to quieten down ] \n > \n > Yes, I said Sarin.

As we speak, Mr. Sullivan is already back on the streets, as are the other members of his activist group. \n > \n > [ More shouts of anger and disbelief ] \n > \n > This meeting today is to address the obvious problem and legal loophole that the case Sullivan uncovered, a loophole which is an enormous threat to the security and safety of our nation. \n > \n > Mr. Sullivan found that a combination of several problematic formulations of our laws allows people to remove weapons of mass destruction and other items deemed illegal by a legally binding convention from the grasp of our military or any organization overseeing their disposal without legal repercussions. \n > \n > The loophole works as follows: It starts with the definition of theft, which is as follows: \n > \n > [ The chairman uses the projection system to show a slide containing several legal definitions ] \n > \n > Definition of theft \n > a: the act of stealing; specifically: the felonious taking and **removing of** personal **property** with intent to deprive the rightful owner of it \n > b: an unlawful taking ( as by embezzlement or burglary ) of property \n > [... ] \n > \n > This definition is then combined with the definition of'property', which is as follows: \n > \n > Definition of property \n > [... ] \n > a: something owned or possessed; specifically: a piece of real estate \n > b: the exclusive **right to possess**, enjoy, **and dispose of a thing**: ownership \n > c: something to which a person or business has a legal title \n > d: one ( as a performer ) who is under contract and whose work is especially valuable \n > e: a book or script purchased for publication or production \n > \n > Furthermore Mr. Sullivan then went further and used the definition of'thing' for his advantage: \n > \n > Definition of thing \n > [... ] \n > 4 \n > a things plural: **possessions**, effects pack your things \n > b: **whatever may be possessed or owned** or be the object of a right \n > c: an article of clothing not a thing to wear \n > d things plural: equipment or utensils especially for a particular purpose bring the tea things \n > \n > I think you can see where I'm going with this.

It had been nearly a decade since the faculty at my would be alma mater laughed me out the door when I had proposed that the classical model of physics was in fact absurdly wrong and did not explain the results I had witnessed in the lab. Relegated to insubstantial work reviewing algorithms at a local software company, I had spent nearly all my free time reviewing my old thesis, refining, perfecting something that even I did n't know how dangerous it could become. \n \n The first signs of Spring had started to appear, rain turned to snow, trees waking from their slumber, and I had finally begun to actually understand the nature of my little side project. The connection of our perception of reality to its actual nature. Time was fluidic, could be warped and manipulated, but the energy requirements were immense. Any device to manipulate time could only be powered by the consumption of the universe itself which, terrifyingly, is not as hard to do as would seem.

He'd been sent back at 20 after a spate of small-scale robberies in tiny shopping centres. He never stole anything worth more than $ 1000; pocket change. One bad night though, he'd accidentally killed the clerk of a small chain-store after taking a gun of one of his accomplices. \n \n Or so we thought. The only evidence we had was the testimony of his accomplice and the footage from the scene of the robbery. Of course the two, both alike in height and ethnicity, wore masks to cover their faces. He had refused to say anything about the night, his `` friend'' mouthed off every last detail, except the one who shot the clerk. Neither meant it, but one got the harsher sentence. \n \n I got called in late on a Tuesday evening, rain belting outside, he'd been pardoned, and was allowed to rejoin the present. I was unsure, most of the time those that in the present were criminals, become criminals in the past. \n Have you ever heard of the Zodiac killer? In the present, he'd been charged with the murder of at least 50 different women, and had been sent back in time. The charges were dropped through lack of evidence and a steely lawyer, and he was ordered back. It soon came out though that he had killed in the past too, but in an awkward legal loophole, the case had been cold for over 200 years, so he could never be charged for the crime, he ended up shot at the trial by a bystander screaming `` justice for all'' \n But that's another story. \n \n They handed me his file. He now went by Harry Winslow, and he lived at 1272 Chester Lane, Wynnbrook, California. Seemed easy enough. I kept reading though, and as I stepped into the garage and into the car - this is how we travel through time, explanations can come later - I noticed something. *1 wife - 2 children - Boy & Girl - 7 & 5 respectively. * I started the car, and the garage door opened, revealing a 2013 Wynnbrook California. There had never been a return who had started a family, ever. In all my years as an agent, only one pardoned convict had had a wife, divorced when we found him in squalor. I suppose though, it was the perfect combination of youth and total innocence. Many of the returns are middle aged when sent off, so in the past, they suddenly wake up a 45-year-old man with not even a high-school diploma, they never end up with a job, and a lot of returns are found dead by suicide. \n \n I tuned down Chester lane. Chester lane was about as typical suburbia as you could get, large American-style house meshed seamlessly with expensive cars and large, well-kept front lawns. The street was lined with trees, giving a dotted shade over the car as I passed under. Dusk was looming, so I rolled down my tinted windows to get a better look at the house numbers. As I did, a child's laughter echoed down the street, joined by a chorus of gleeful shrieks. I pulled up outside 1272. A well-built middle aged man was running around the yard holding a football, with two children trailing behind him at full pelt, laughing. Suddenly the two jumped on him and he dove to the ground. `` 1 Down'' I heard the little boy cry. and the man boomed with laughter. Up on the steps of the house, a pregnant woman watched on, smiling. This was n't right at all. I checked the file again. Everything matched. The attached photo resembled the man currently tickling his son if he was twenty years younger. This was n't right at all. None of it was meant to go this way. It was meant to be a prison for people, a hell, forcing them into hardship and depression for the horrendous crimes they'd committed. They were n't supposed to turn around. They were n't supposed to be happy. \n \n As I looked again at the man, throwing his daughter up in he air and catching her again, to her overwhelming delight, I thought about what bringing him back would do. He'd lose all this, all his happiness, he'd lose everything he had here, to rejoin a present where he had nothing, and which had absolutely nothing to offer him. Beyond just him, he now had a family he had to support, and a new child on the way. I rolled up the window again, the orange sun was catching my eye on the horizon line, and peeled out. \n \n I phoned in. \n \n `` Another suicide.'' \n \n \n \n\n"}

Her fault, he repeated. Her fault. \n \n Her goddamn fault. \n \n He played to distract his raging mind. To stall, to think, to try to reason with his already made up mind. But he knew there was no convincing his joy ridden being to act otherwise. He gripped the whiskey with his shaking palm and raised it to his pursed lips, the sting of the drink all too familiar on his tongue. He tried to strum again but could n't find the strength anymore. His heart could n't wander the planes of his conscious any longer. There's only so much pain even the strongest man could endure. \n \n He ran his hand through his unattended facial hair as he swallowed his therapy, letting his eyes dart from picture to picture lining the walls. Memories of the years. Of a fading love. \n \n Their smiles showed happiness but the mutual, hanging thought of `` something better'' poisoned their minds, always evident in their eyes. Never said but always acknowledged, never wanted but always needed. They assumed it was better than no feeling at all. He would rather feel nothing than what he feels now; what he knows he must do, that unstoppable fire in his chest. \n \n Her goddamn fault. \n \n He rested his weight on the wooden chair's handle and used it as leverage to raise up on his tired feet.

The way she fucking looked in his eyes; that unforgettable stare. Every detail, every touch and shadow and sound like a slice to the throat, a strike to the gut, a horrendous crime against his very being as the man that protected her for all of those godforsaken years. A spark to his flame deep inside. Betrayal. Unforgivable betrayal. \n \n He concluded that there is no God and Lucifer was lying in the next room; disguised in the curves of a woman that had once said, `` I love you.'' \n \n A deep breath. Regret may have entered his mind for only a millisecond, but the imagine of her in their bed that night made the thought wisp away and hide in the back of his mind in cowardice. All he knew was rage now. He slowly turned and picked up his sturdy, reliable shotgun. He'd taught her how to shoot with this very firearm. Now this trigger would teach her a lesson not soon forgotten. \n \n Her goddamn fault. \n \n Switching off the safety, he turned the knob to the bedroom door and slowly walked toward where she was lying, the floor anticipating every step and every creak seemed to be a foretelling sound. Stopping for only a moment, he observed her resting face and how she breathed, a breath just as familiar as the taste of his whiskey. \n \n `` You could end it now,'' he thought. \n \n `` No,'' he immediately dismissed. \n \n What happened next can only be reasoned as thus- a heart knows only love when it holds it, and when this is ripped away all a soul can cling to is revenge. \n \n `` Wake the fuck up,'' he yelled drunkenly, her eyes opening immediately, training on the barrel pointed to her face. \n \n She panicked. What else would a person do? `` Oh my god, oh my god, what are you doing? Oh god, oh god please help me, Jesus sav-'' \n \n `` Shut the fuck up,'' he muttered, almost as quiet as a whisper but the anger behind it reflected a blistering scream. She fell silent. \n \n `` I know what you did. What you've done..'' his voice fell off. He had so much he wanted to say but could n't muster the words. A tear streaked down his cheek, but he wiped it away quickly and pushed the barrel against her chest. She screamed. \n \n `` I'm so sorry; you have it all wrong; the spark has been gone for years; I deserve to be happy,'' she begged and pleaded through her tears, her body shaking uncontrollably and her voice cracking in every sentence. He expected her words, he expected her pleas. He did n't care. \n \n Her. Goddamn. Fault. \n \n `` Daddy?'' \n \n Their shared daughter was standing in the doorway. So young. Her third birthday was a month and a half ago. \n \n `` Do n't watch, sweetie.''

But no one came. \n \n `` Daddy, what are you doing? Why is mommy crying?'' \n \n The woman wanted to comfort her child with words but feared for her own life; if she opened her mouth the drunken man she loved may make sure she never spoke again. \n \n Little did she know; he wanted to do no such thing. \n \n `` Turn around, baby,'' he spoke calmly to to his daughter, no emotion backing his words. `` Go back to your room. Do n't come back in here. I love you.'' The small child refused to leave; the man being unaware of this, maybe too drunk or too distracted, he continued on with his task. Blissful ignorance, the stubbornness of a child. This would ruin her life forevermore. \n \n He dragged his wife off the bed by the shoulder and placed her face-to-face with himself. She did n't fight him, she was almost paralyzed with fear. He pressed his forehead against hers, and dug the gun into her abdomen. She sobbed like he had never heard before. For a reason only he fully understood, looking through the eyes of the fire in his heart... \n \n It made him smile. \n \n With the swiftness and motivation of a starving animal, he pulled the barrel of the gun up under his chin. Looking her in the eyes deeply, communicating every dark emotion she made him feel for the past ninety six hours and every tear she made him shed in just one fateful second, he pulled the trigger and ended his own life only six inches away from her face. \n \n The last thing he ever heard was his daughter's scream. \n \n Then, and only then, did he feel regret. \n \n And, despite everything, that unforgettable scream was his goddamn fault. \n \n \n \n\n"}

Echoes of life swimming beneath the ripples of its surface, fragmented and incoherent like the pieces were now, forced into new shapes, learning new memories. Chair memories and broom memories, charcoal I sketched with even putting memory to paper as it lost its power to retain. But my father's desk, grandfathers before him, and older still than that man, rugged and oaken, huge and dark and full of men's thoughts, still dreamed like a tree. \n \n I was twelve when I found the book that talked of witches and warlocks and all things fae the average villager need fear. The book was old then of course, and most who held superstitions were too, like my father's mother who had kept it. She was happy to let me read my discovery after a little more work clearing out the attic with grandfather. The effort was warm and sweaty in the afternoon sun, we had the shutters open for the breeze blowing in fresh with the scent of the summer wood, and my grandfather, realising there was still a great deal to do, brushed some dust off of my head and shoulders with a calloused hand, tousled my hair and handed me my book while saying'go hound your grandma for some lemonade'. \n \n So as I left for the stairs I put a hand on the nearest beam and listened while the floorboards creaked and groaned, revelled in the sighs and whispers behind them that it seemed people were seldom aware of. The sounds of an old house and of the older wood. My grandmother through a magic of her own had known we were ready for a break, and there stood a tall glass of lemonade waiting for me in my favourite spot on the table near the bench on the deck outside. I settled into the bench and heard what I had come to know as relief that it was not the significantly greater weight of my heavy shouldered grandfather easing to rest, and smiled at the thought. My smile widened as I saw the woods the breeze had blown through, green and gold and full of life. I remembered my father's desk while the voices of the trees swept over me. How its voice was older than this house, and how I somehow knew that out there beyond the green and sun, was the heart of the forest. Darker, and secret, and full of stories. \n \n Then I remembered my new book, and how it held some stories easier to get my hands on with tired legs and parental supervision. \n \n I turned the pages and looked at skilled drawings of fantastical creatures, unicorns and knifetooth cats, devils and draugr and even a large bat like creature I decided was not a dragon, but so it was labelled. Scanning through more entries dedicated to which root vegetables could keep away which lycanthrope or vampire, my eyes were caught by some unsettlingly like my own. \n \n I was looking at my mother. \n \n The page was marked ‘ Dryads ’, and I read on. \n \n “ Dryads: Nymphs of the trees. Commonly argued to be forces of nature and life, most of my collated evidence suggests they are more similar to the Sirens of the northern ocean. Beautiful things, seemingly all female, purportedly innocuous, they use their charms and songs to tempt otherwise noble men ( and accountably women ) from their duties to the Church and Dukedom to unknown ends. Predators truly, their beauty should be trusted no more than the bright colours of a poisonous toad, and their nefarious ungodly magics avoided at all costs. Keep your children and loose husbands away from the wood, most certainly at night, and weave a garland of ragweed and swordgrass to dissuade their corrupting presence. ” \n \n I thought over this analysis sceptically, having no true intention of believing words like this about anyone resembling my mother. Certainly not from someone who didn ’ t know what a dragon looked like. \n \n My eyes found hers again and I fell into the page and memory. \n \n My father found me that night in her chair in, well, only his room now. It was solid and oaken, and it rocked. I remembered it from when I was small enough to sit on her lap, and she would sing to me songs that wove between the echoes of life all around us. The chair remembered too, but it was a false image of her, like in the book. Imperfect, however beautiful, untrue to what it meant to have a mother to hold. \n \n My father reminded me I still had him when he thudded into the room. He noticed my tear tracks and heard sobs turned to sniffles, and after offering me a chance to collect myself further by removing his rugged boots and hide jacket, he swept me up and onto his knee while he sat in the chair himself, hugging me close, stubbled chin scratching my head as he kissed me. \n \n He was solid, and human, and now he rocked. I could feel the song echo in the empty space inside him where my mother once was. Where my sister would have been too, had she been born. Some part of him knew what was missing because he started to hum, a little off key, and not as melodious as she was. But it helped us both and I joined in. \n\n"}

What would be wrong with this one I thought - Cancer? A tumor? You never really can tell until those tests come back, like winning a lottery, a lottery of life and death for someone else. \n \n I waited a good twenty minutes, until the brain was finally carted in. *'' Finally'' * I thought, as I hooked up the brain to the neuro-bands and started the preliminary scan. After about 10 minutes, with a loud *'' BEEP*'' from the speakers at my station, my scan was done. I did n't see anything odd at first, until I looked at the inner-core scan. I peered at the coding on the screen and saw something quite peculiar near the end of the DNA strand code... \n \n *''... aaatccREADME.txt'' * \n \n Was this a mistake in the scan? Did my machine malfunction? I had no idea what to think at this point, and there was no one else that would be able to help me out if this was a malfunction. I decided it would be best to just mouse over the text to manually delete it from the scan, and then I would just call it a night. However, when I moused over it, the README.txt line of code was able to be clicked on! As my index finger trembled over the left-click of my computer mouse for a good 2 minutes, I finally decided to give it a go. I pressed down on my mouse, and firmly gave it a *Click*, as a window popped open on my screen, and a few lines of text started to type, all on its own... \n \n *'' Thank you for accessing the MZ-3024 - external memory video database. `` * \n \n *'' Compiling internal storage...'' * \n \n *'' Initiating files for playback...'' * \n \n *'' Coding years 3000 through 3100...'' * \n \n I looked at the screen, eyes wide open - I could n't believe what I was seeing. Did someone find a way to compile visual memories into a brain? A brain chip?... that was from the future?! The year was only 2035, with the year 3000 still being over nine-hundred years away. My screen had tons of code processing up and down the screen for a good five minutes, as I watched in confusion and awe. The scanning process finally stopped and all I saw on the black screen were the words: \n \n *'' Playback files ready... would you like to proceed?

I did n't know what to do... what consequences would unfold from the wrong decision... what would happen if I chose to open this file... My index finger trembled over my the left-click of my computer mouse. Finally after about five minutes of processing this all through my head, and moving my mouse pointer back and fourth like a madman... I pressed down on the left side of my mouse, and firmly gave it a *Click*. \n \n\n"}

My hair is dirty, dread locked, and caked with mud and oil thier cars leave behind. My heart scarred with the memories of the life I once had. I had a family with a little boy, I watched him grow up, I protected him, and for a time I was his world. \n \n I now walk these streets alone, and sometimes scared longing for a love I once had, but the only thing I have found is hate. Some start thier lives with hate. Others start with love but hate at some point in time grabs a hold of them and leeches into thier souls, that is what happened to my sweet boy. I walk up to a group of men leaning on the building. These humans not only hate me, but each other. I feel malice emminating off of them in waves, they crash upon me as they shout, `` shoo, go on and get out of here.'' I can feel one is considering giving me a chase as his grip tightens on the cane in his hand. \n \n Just as I turn to take my leave I feel it my ears perk up, can it be? I feel love forgetting the men behind me I bolt twards it. How reckless of me as I run twards the girl who is sending me soft pulses of love, the warmth threatening to make me forget to approach more cautiously. She sees me and I can feel a small bitter tinge of fear leak out of her but still the flow of love overwhelmingly coming from her. \n \n I slow my approach, and the fear ebbs a bit but still a hint of it remains. I know I must appear terrifying and I have not seen clean water and a brush in quite some time, so long infact I have lost track. I reach my target and flop over on my back, tail wagging, heart threatening to explode. The fear almost completely gone as she bends down to me and pats my head. \n \n `` Come on girl, what are you doing here? Will you walk me home?'' She cooed. I leaped up tail helicoptering behind me. I found hope once again. The girl giggled and together we walked. As we walked we came upon the bad men I encountered before. The vile hate still so heavily suffocating in the air. I know this is no good, I whine and try to get the girl to turn around. \n \n Then I feel the hate bubble and shift behind me. Then the one with the cane spoke. `` Hello little girl, where are you headed all alone in a place like this?'' \n \n `` Alone? I'm not alone.'' She replied. As sour waves of fear now pound off of her. She is right she is not alone I am here. I sneer and growl back at the man. Now more hesitant to approach. This time boy I will not let you off I barked menicingly. I lunged and grabbed his cane, warning shot has been fired I bellowed next it will be painful. Now the sour waves of fear are coming off the man as he yelps `` call the mutt off.'' \n \n You stupid hateful man I will protect this girl and her love as long as I can, I turn to the girl and plead with her to leave, she must have sensed it and turned to run as the cane connected with my side. Thankful now that she was running and on her way to safety the man now had my full attention. I latched onto his arm and was quickly swarmed by his friends. I recieved many kicks and punched and eventually let the man go. Satisfied to help thier friend and leave me limping away. `` MOM!'' She cried out `` she made it please come help.'' That my friends is how I foundmy new home and it is full of more warm, and delightful love than I ever imagined finding in the world. \n \n I followed the girls trail of love and sadness she left behind to find her home on her porch weeping, and sobbing for of all the things in the world me. \n She sees me battle worn, and injured as I flop in front of her yet again my heart about to flutter out of my chest and tail wagging as much as I can while internally bleeding.\n"}

He had no idea why, it was just some sort of... Instinct. He glanced around, confused. He had no idea where he was... It was his room for sure, but at the same time, it was n't. It was n't the bare white walls lacking decoration with the mess of gaming consoles, controllers and miscellaneous wires as usual, his eyes were met with a much softer sight. Surprisingly familiar, even... He could hear the rustling of the trees outside as the temperate wind lazily brushed through the leaves of the tree just outside, golden shafts of light shimmering into the room through the open blinds, wonderfully illuminating the flowered wallpaper adorning each of the walls. His childhood home... He knew it had to be... After all, this wallpaper was n't any normal wallpaper, his mother made it herself! He had vague, yet fond memories of watching her cheerily paint each individual flower when he was just a few years old. A far better time that was, before all of the non-fatal, yet crippling diseases that life apparently thought his parents deserved, and all the financial troubles that came from said diseases... He slowly stood up, glancing down at the plush carpet beneath his feet, and even wriggling his toes slightly just for the sake of getting a better feel for the softness of it. After taking a quick glance around to better appreciate the beauty of the room, he made his way over to the window, pulling up the blinds and looking outside. He had to raise a hand to block the sun, it was clearly very early in the morning, likely under an hour after dawn, and the sun was casting a gorgeous golding glow over the wonderfully familiar suburban neighborhood that stood just outside. Part of him wanted to wake himself up to make sure this was actually a dream, part of him wanted to try and manipulate this dream, and part of him even tried to tell himself that there was something wrong here, that no dream should be this vivid. But... He could n't bring himself to heed his own words. It was... Beautiful here, beyond belief... He felt a sense of inner peace and a gentle happiness like nothing he'd ever felt before, and before he knew it, he had a pair of pajama pants thrown on over his boxers and a soft shirt several times too large for himself; Just how he likes his pajama shirts. He opened his door, which swung open quietly and with ease. A nice change from how the doors tended to squeak and some of the knobs tended to get stuck in their current house, though for a moment, he sincerely wondered if the dream went silent, he was so used to it. He was immediately reassured that was not the case as he stepped out into the hallway and heard the soft thudding of his feet making contact with the carpet below, warmed to a comfortable temperature by the venting running through the floors, and the quieted yet still distinctive music of a Harry Potter movie coming from the room at the bottom of the stairs, and if he were a betting man ( and had anyone to bet with ), he would've placed a sizable bet that it was the moment Harry first entered Diagon Alley with Hagrid in the first movie. He glanced left down the hall, spotting the closet, upstairs bathroom, the other bedrooms, and the upstairs living room-or the playroom as they used to call it, when it was the designated gaming room for him and his two elder siblings. He turned to the right and made his way down the soft carpet stairs, and into the living room, only to see a sight that shocked him beyond belief, though not one he would dare call unpleasant. He saw a more mature version of himself sitting on the couch on the far wall, an absolutely serene look on his face as he rested there and watched the movie playing on the TV that was set up parallel to the stairs, an arm wrapped around a petite, adorable woman with curled, golden blonde hair, and an infant lovingly cradled in her arms. She was resting against him, clearly asleep, with an equally serene expression on her face. The second of himself, the one on the couch with the woman and child, gave a broad grin as he saw his younger version peering at the sight from halfway down the stairs. `` Hey there kiddo.'' He said in a hushed tone. \n \n `` Jesus fucking christ, you have n't changed one bit, have you...?'' The younger said with a clear tone of astonishment. \n \n The older gave a soft chuckle, saying `` Nope, just the same old jackass I always was.'' \n \n `` Except with what I *assume* to be a wife and child...'' \n \n `` *Nooo*, I'm borrowing *Bill's* wife and child!'' The older says in a blatantly sarcastic tone. \n \n `` Okay *smartass*, then how'd you even score such a lovely little thing like that in the first place?'' Despite the vitriolic exchanges, the two men only seemed more comfortable than ever. After all, this was n't anything out of the ordinary for either of them; This was just how they played around, and both of them knew that. \n \n `` Come here first and I *might* think about the *possibility* of telling you.'' The older suggests, making a vague gesture to the free space next to him on the couch. \n \n `` Aight.'' The teen mutters, going to head the rest of the way down the stairs and sit next to his more matured self. `` Well, I'm here. Now what?'' \n \n `` Now you stew in your jealousy for a couple weeks, move on, and live your life.'S how *I* got here!'' the older said with a smug smirk, causing the younger to furrow his brow. \n \n `` Mind elaborating?'' He asks, slightly displeased with the answer he got, though still overall quite content with his situation. \n \n `` I was once in the same exact position you're in right now, taking to an older me and desperate to be in his position. And then I got there.'' The older says, sounding quite contented. \n \n `` Okay, but *how*?'' The younger asks, sounding slightly annoyed. \n \n `` How what?'' The older asks, feigning obliviousness \n \n `` How did you *get* here, you fucking asshole?'' The younger asked, only slightly annoyed, but not bothering with his vocal filter when only with himself. \n \n `` Oh, right, yeah! That! It was pretty easy actually. The first thing I did was pull that giant stick out of my ass and live life.'' The older says, staring at the younger with way too wide of a smile, clearly quite smugly satisfied with his response. \n \n `` You're going to actively refuse to help me out on this one, are n't you?'' The younger says, annoyance clear in his tone. \n \n `` Hey dude, *neither* of us here like spoilers for a game we're super excited to play, yeah? I just do n't wan na spoil the game of life for you!'' The older's shit-eating grin only seems to widen as he says this, and the younger's brow furrows further, eyes narrowing slightly. \n \n `` Oh. Gee. Yeah. Thanks. How thoughtful of you. I am... Super appreciative of this.'' The younger says in the most deadpan sarcastic tone he could muster. \n \n `` Yup! No problem!'' The older feigns as if the younger meant his words, gently stroking the hair of the woman nestled up next to him. \n \n ( Too long for one comment, splitting in two )\n"}

Run. Run like the wind. The objective is just there on the other side.'' \n \n Finally, the signal was given, and we surged as one towards The Enemy. For the first few meters, we encountered no resistance. We were emboldened, thinking that victory was within our grasp. \n \n We were wrong.

I looked ahead in horror, as the very fabric of reality was torn asunder by The Enemy's foul sorcery. Right before my eyes, a tower materialised, one vastly different from the ones I left behind.

I sobbed in the back, my mother sobbed up front. Only my father could choke back his tears. \n \n `` Daddy,'' I asked, `` was it a serial killer?'' Before he replied there were headlights appeared on the top of the hill. \n \n My father said, `` What the...'' we never got visitors, especially not in the middle of the night. `` They're not taking us too!'' He swerved into the fields beside the road and slammed on the gas. \n \n My mother looked at the phone, `` Our service has been cut off. Honey, what's happening?'' \n \n `` It appears whoever took our daughter is out for us too.'' We burst out of the crops and onto the road. There were police cars blocking the road. Our truck crashed into one and we tumbled off the road. I found myself laying on the ceiling. Boots were approaching the car. \n \n `` Do n't move, we mean no harm.'' A voice said. It did n't sound like a sinister serial killer's voice, it sounded like the voice of a police officer. \n \n Turns out that was a pretty close guess. \n \n It was a group of people in suits and sunglasses even though it was dark. They gave us blankets and coffee to my parents ( I got a milkshake ) and escorted us to the mobile lab. Which was a semi-truck with a clean laboratory full of computers and instruments in the trailer. \n \n ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n Edit: Part 2 is up!\n"}

The beginning of school. One of the most memorable parts of a child's life. Golden morning rays shine selfishly through panes of glass. The shuffling of desks and chairs as they get settled in. A modest room, with a clock on the front wall, a teachers desk sitting observantly to a weathered chalk board. A warm face greets them, a new teacher, young and almost as excited on her first day as the children were for theirs. \n \n However on this day, not everyone had such an innocent beginning. In a dark room filled with gear sat a man looking at a monitor. A smug tone to his attitude. `` Today'' the man said, `` Today is the start of the true world.'' A repeated phrase by a lesser man. The North Korean agent watches through cameras. Intelligence mission, to have a grasp of American life. A camera in a park, street corners, McDonalds, and one of a first grade class. \n \n Such a class was now presenting what they had done that summer. A few Disneyland trips, grandparent visits, and one child, a child with a story so unusual to the rest. Nervous, he stepped up to the board. A memory goes through his mind, the first in his nervous shanty of a conscience. New parents, a new meal, A hasty and reckless explanation by an overworked parent, and the careless words of a young father was repeated boldly before this class. The meaning of soup in this young child's mind made to words and took of `` My mashed potatoes and gravy had a baby.'' \n \n A release of gas canisters, somewhere in the dark. The agent slumped over his keyboard. A casualty no more important than the rats living under this rural base to those who would n't find the body. All because of those christened words over a speaker, `` My mashed potatoes and gravy had a baby''. Meanwhile, the ripple of laughter subsided in the first grade class, the teacher had her first of many experiences which makes her remember why she became a teacher. A child oblivious as to how many lives he had just saved, with such a simple phrase... \n \n My mashed potatoes and gravy, had a baby. \n \n\n"}

That I need paid. Debts with *Greg*.'' The name slipped out \n of his mouth like oil. \n \n `` Okay,'' Satan said. It was n't ideal, but what the hell? The glory days of deals with the devil had died with Faust. These days he took what he could get. `` All right. Tell me what kind of debts these are.'' \n \n & nbsp; \n \n They stepped out of the bedroom and a voice immediately reached them. `` Took you long enough!'' \n \n Satan stopped, but the boy kept going towards the living room, where four other boys his age sat around a \n wooden table. \n \n `` This is my friend the Devil.'' The kid said, with a wave back at Satan. `` He's here to pay my debts.'' \n \n Satan looked around the pimpled-ridden faces and half-filled Mountain Dew glasses on the table. He stepped \n closer. `` What in the world –'' his eyes stopped on the Monopoly board. `` Oh.'' \n \n The boy came back, took his hand and dragged him closer to the board. `` So… I'd like to pay for my stop in Park Place. In addition to that, I'll be adding hotels to Pennsylvania Ave *and* to North Carolina Ave. Also houses in all the red properties.'' \n \n `` Dude,'' Satan started, tired. \n \n `` You ca n't do that!''

Someone who would trade their soul for something \n worthy? * \n \n `` So… you want a Ferrari?'' Satan asked. \n \n The kid nodded. `` Yes,'' he said, simply. `` Model F-40, black, vintage edition, two-thousand and two. I've wanted one for years.'' \n \n `` Okay… that I can arrange. Are you willing to trade your soul for it?'' \n \n `` I am.'' \n \n Satan smiled. Not a wasted trip to Earth after all. \n \n The kid smiled in return. He pulled his phone. `` Hang on, let me see if they still have it.'' \n \n Satan frowned. `` What are you doing? I can get it for you even if they do n't --'' \n \n `` I'm just checking the Hot Wheels website to see if they still have that model for sale.'' \n \n `` Oh fuck you all,'' Satan said, puffing fire out of his cheeks and setting the house on fire ( which, to be fair, did heat \n the pizza slice, so that was nice. ) \n \n ______ \n \n *Thanks for reading!

I do n't care what my other texts messages say, he was n't even there! \n \n \n BW: What happened after the text? \n \n \n TS: I went back to the party. \n \n \n BW: Do you remember what happened next? \n \n \n TS: Yeah, the cops showed up and smoked the party. \n \n \n HRB: Mr. Luo, there is a significant gap in between when you received the text and when the police arrived. What happened in between? \n \n \n TS: I drank! What else do you do at a party. \n \n \n HRB: Do not dismiss the questions. You are still under oath. \n \n \n BW: Who did you talk to? Did you use your phone? Did you go to the bathroom at all? \n \n \n TS: What does it matter? Alex is dead. He got into a car accident after he left! \n \n \n HRB: It is imperative that you tell us what happened. Because you were the host of the party, you are a contributor to his eventual negligence on the road. This is what is known as `` host liability.'' \n \n \n TS: A load of crap. \n \n \n BW: You understand that we can take that as an admission of guilt, right? \n \n \n TS: I did n't even know he drove to the party!

Did you know all of them? \n \n \n TS: Well, duh. \n \n \n BW: Your Honor, may I show him the invitation? \n \n \n HRB: I'll allow it. \n \n \n BW: Mr. Luo, you invited a total of forty seven people to this party on Facebook. There is evidence that others, aside from Alex, drove to the party. While we ca n't be sure who left before the police- \n \n \n TS: No crap. \n \n \n BW:... the police arrive, but we can confirmed who drove. Your friend Alex was one of those who RSVP'd and mentioned they were going to drive. He was specific to the time and to the vehicle. \n \n \n TS: So what? I do n't remember reading it. \n \n \n BW: You directly replied, Mr. Luo. You said, and I quote, `` Cool bud, I'll see you there!'' \n \n \n HRB: This is a mediation Mr. Luo. Even without this, there is significant evidence that suggests that you were fully aware of your friend's intention to drive home under the influence. Between testimonies alleging that you egg'd people on to drive home, the police report as well as the female that stayed over for the night, there is enough evidence to condemn you to more than a juvenile sentence. \n \n \n BW: We're offering you the option to come clean. Admit guilt and we can reduce your sentence. \n \n \n TS: I get screwed either way! I admit guilt, I'm 100 % guilty. Deny and I'm still in front of a jury and they'll get me anyways! I'm screwed! \n \n \n BW: You can choose how long you stay inside for. \n \n \n TS: Listen. When this name came up, I did the right thing and called the police.

Every form of entertainment has said that the longer you live the more sadness you accumulate", "human": "I like how all forms of media have basically demonized immortality. Every form of entertainment has said that the longer you live the more sadness you accumulate. They are quite right but people seem to only focus on the bad. I have lived for centuries and I have experienced just as many happy moments as I did sad ones. \n \n I think the key to it is to have a goal. \n \n A man can never truly live life if he does n't have goal. Sadly, the more normal goal of'stay alive and have a happy life' can not apply to me any more so I have had to find other goals. \n \n Some of my goals were noble but done through ill means. \n \n Some of the goals had been entirely selfless, and led me to being called a great man. \n \n Others had been to solve problems for others. \n \n Even more had been selfish goals that made me both demonized and idolized. \n \n Through these goals I have meet my best friends and my most hated enemies. Found the the love of my life many times over the centuries, something akin to reincarnation. I have raised children to become great people and helped those turn from darker paths they could have led. \n \n But it is true what they say about immortality, it is a curse. I have lived for so long that I have lost so many goals. There is only so many times the same goal can be accomplished in different way that you know what do do before you even set out to do them. \n \n At least, until now. \n \n `` Stabilizers calibrated. Prepare injections.'' A voice said through an intercom. \n \n `` Geez, I feel like I am in Star Trek again.'' \n \n `` What's that?'' a female voice asked. She was the leader on this project. Her name was Clymene Tenstarov. Very bizarre name if you ask me but her famliy did n't know the origins. I guess that why I find this whole thing a little comedic and slightly prophetic. \n \n `` An old TV show. Mostly about science fiction stuff. Kinda like right now.'' \n \n `` Really?'' she asked with a bit of a smile, `` Did they do something like this?'' \n \n `` I do n't remember. There were so many incarnations of the show that they probably did it.'' \n \n `` You should have remembered earlier. We could have made feel a bit nostalgic if we had known about it.'' She said with a bit of a chuckled. \n \n `` Injection ready. Grounding poles ready.'' The voice on the intercom said. Clymene looked at me and her smile broke a bit as she said, `` This might hurt a bit.'' \n \n `` Please. Have you ever been shot by a tank. That hurts.'' I said laughing. She did n't look convinced but proceeded anyway. It did hurt. Not the same as taking a tank shot to the chest but it still hurt. Putting in metal rods into all of my joints, bones and spin was not going to be painless. I did n't scream though, year of living taught me how not too. \n \n `` Grounding poles set. Vitals reading elevated stress and adrenaline. He's stable.'' \n \n `` So you really are an immortal man.'' Clymene said appreciatively. \n \n `` Why would I lie about that?'' \n \n `` I just did n't think a phenomenon like yourself would actually exist.'' \n \n `` You would have believed me if you spent a night in bed with me.'' I said jokingly with a smile. \n \n `` Hmph. Maybe, that would have been a night.'' She replied and we laughed. \n \n `` Setting fluctuation intervals. Gravitational constants set. Radiation levels normal.'' A pause, `` He's ready.'' \n \n Clymene grasped my hand. I could barely feel it. She looked into my eyes with mixed emotion that, if it were not for my years on this earth, I would n't be able to tell were. After a tight squeeze of it she said, `` Thank you. For doing this. People my not know what you did for them but we will be able to thank you for it.'' \n \n `` Do n't worry about it. It high time this happen to me.'' I said as the table I was one started moving, `` Besides I should be thanking you. With this, I finally have a realistic goal.'' \n \n `` What's that?'' \n \n `` To die for someone else.'' I replied. She looked a bit shocked but I continued, `` Do n't worry, it's not for you.'' Which got her to laugh, `` At least, not just for you.'' \n \n `` Launch ready.'' The voice in the intercom said, as I was closed into a large capsule. I could barely see any of the scientist anymore. Rumbling started and I felt heat rising from beneath me. I could only barely hear but the countdown had started. I looked up to my destination. The sun. \n \n It had started collapsing a 12 decades ago but no one could solve the problem back then. Eight decades later they had found the solution to the problem but no way to actually create it. The reason for it because they needed a living being to be a sort of grounding point for the gravitational center. I only found out about it by accident. When they explained it to me, I knew that this would be my final goal. \n \n I do n't remember my first name. Its been so long since I used it that its I had forgotten about it. I remember some of my names though; Maximus, Jeremy, Bennoi, Zhul-Ka, Yamahrna. Lots of them. But for today and for now on, I'm Project Atlas. \n \n I've had my last meal 13 times, final words 29 times, and been to my funeral 9 times... I think this may be the one I do n't walk away from. \n \n And you know what? \n \n I'm glad. \n \n `` Project Atlas was a success. Congratulations, you just saved the sun.''\n"}

After I lost my job at the mine over a year ago, we've had to rely on her to help us with our mortgage until we're able to get back on our feet. Her financial assistance comes with a catch – we must Sunday afternoons with her. Today she is making us take her bomb shelter shopping. She is convinced that President Trump will result in World War III and that she needs to be prepared. \n \n “ This one looks really nice, ” Sarah says. \n \n The five bedroom, 2500 sq ft “ Extreme Lux ” bomb shelter model, priced at what Sarah describes as, “ a moderate $ 2.1M dollars, ” has one of the most beautiful interiors I've ever see. \n \n “ Bob's bomb shelters does not disappoint, ” Sarah continues. \n \n “ You ca n't get the real experience unless we close the hatch, ” says the shelter salesman. The salesman, whose name I did n't catch when we arrived, proceeds to close the hatch to the bomb shelter. I can feel a tingle down my spine as he closes it and my claustrophobia creeps in. Sarah and Karen proceed to tour the shelter, while I try to calm myself and catch my breath. Just when I feel like I have collected myself – **BANG**. \n \n “ Wow – they really take the sales experience seriously here, ” Sarah exclaims. \n \n I too think to myself that this must be an elaborate sales tactic of Bob's bomb shelters, but then I turn to look at the salesman. His face is one that I've seen before. It's the same face as my former colleagues when a large portion of the mine that we worked in collapsed and left us stranded underground for two weeks. It's the face of absolute fear in an uncertain and terrifying future. \n \n “ What the hell just happened, this is n't fake is it? ” \n \n “ The hatch and walls have the best soundproofing money can buy... this ca n't be happening, ” the salesman whispered under his breath. \n \n Filled with fear, Karen ran to the hatch and immediately started to unlock it. \n \n “ DO N'T DO IT! THERE'S LIKELY BEEN A NUCLEAR BLAST! ” the salesman screamed. \n \n Karen ignores his words and proceeds to open the hatch. She looks up at the sky and a big smile crosses her face. \n \n “ Everything looks fine to me - the sky is as blue as ever! ” she says joyfully. \n \n We all breath a collective sigh of relief and exit the shelter. Everything on the outside looks fine, but none of us can discern where the noise came from. \n \n “ I've had enough excitement for one day, we're going home to watch the game. ” \n \n Sarah and Karen agree and we get into the car. After about two minutes of driving, we notice that there is a stalled car in the middle of the highway. Proceeding slowly, I drive around it, noticing that there is no one in the car or around it. It did n't take long before we pulled up to another eight cars, each of which seem abandoned in the same fashion. I pull the car over to the side of the road in an effort to make some sense of this. \n \n “ Sarah, Karen, could you please check your phones to see if we can find out if anything's happened? ” \n \n We soon realize that none of our phones have service. \n \n “ Perhaps there's something on the radio, ” Karen says. \n \n After scanning for stations, the only available station is W97.5FM – country radio. Much to our surprise, it was n't country music that was playing but the U.S. Emergency Alert System. After a long unsettling monotone signal, a warning message came across. \n \n “ The following message is transmitted at the request of the Federal Government of the United States. There has been an unknown biological attack on the United States. Current estimates indicate that the 97 % of the population has been eliminated by this attack. We are urging any survivors to go immediately to the closest government shelter. ” \n \n After listening to the entire message in horror, we realize that the closest identified shelter in the alert is nearly 100 miles away. After about an hour of trying to grasp the gravity of the situation, Sarah and Karen make their respective positions clear. \n \n “ We should go back to Bob's bomb shelter in case there's another attack. We'll be safe there, ” Sarah insists. \n \n “ The government shelter is only a 100km mom, we should go there instead, ” Karen says. \n \n We debate where to go for some time, but Karen and I ultimately accept Sarah's plan. We arrive at Bob's and quickly notice that the salesman is frantically moving metal boxes into the “ Extreme Lux ” bomb shelter model. \n \n “ Hey Bob! Can we talk for a minute, ” Sarah shouts. \n \n This was the first time that I realized that the salesman is the “ Bob ” in “ Bob's bomb shelters ”. Bob proceeds to ignore Sarah's calls and continues to stock up the shelter. As we get closer, Bob quickly runs into his single trailer office which is on the lot. After a few seconds, Bob comes out with a rifle aimed towards us and cocks it. \n \n “ You need to leave right now. There's no room for ya' all here, ” Bob yells. \n \n It becomes clear that Bob has heard the announcement and is aware of the situation. \n \n “ I'm warning you, if you come any closer I'll kill ya! ” \n \n “ I'm sure there's plenty of room for all of us in one of your shelters. Please let us in, ” Sarah pleads. \n \n “ I only have enough supplies for me for two years. I'm not going to spread them across three more people who I dunno. ” \n \n Karen steps forward and yells, “ you ca n't treat people like this... you need to let us in. ” \n \n As I move to try to grab her and pull her away from Bob – **BANG**. Bob fires his rifle, hitting Karen directly in the chest. \n \n “ I... I told you I'd do it. Get away from here or else I'll shoot again ” \n \n Sarah and I begin to scream hysterically as we watch Karen begin to bleed out. I quickly pull Karen's bloody body back into the car and Sarah joins her in the back seat. \n \n\n"}

He was also only 13 years old, but stood at an enormous six-foot-two, and had huge, sinewy arms that looked built for snapping the necks of dorks like me who liked to stay indoors and read manga. Darry was a magnificently interesting creature in the most scientific sense, as I had always thought he bore rather uncanny physical similarities to an ape. I could n't help but link this to how his emotional and intellectual spectrum seem to span no longer than a pencil shaving. He always talked really loud with his friends and had a laugh that echoed throughout the nervous silence of the school corridors. Today in particular, he was talking especially loud to ensure that everyone could him brag about his family's legendary history of tattoos. \n \n `` Gee I really do n't know what tattoo will appear on me tomorrow. My Dad has a lion on his arm, representing the strength and power he has, and my Mum has a flower on her wrist because she loves nature and is a very delicate person. I reckon I could get a lion too.'' He boomed proudly. I sighed and thought about the beautiful tattoos only people like Darry seemed to get. Kids like me normally got simple geometric tattoos, like squares or numbers, normally representing our simplistic nature, or foreshadowing a career in accounting. There was no question that Darry's social standing would improve even more after tomorrow, the day he would be turning 14 and getting a kickass tattoo. In the middle of my dazed state I had n't noticed that I'd been staring at him the whole time. \n \n \n `` What do you think you're looking at? Ca n't take your eyes off me? Sorry, I'm not into guys.'' He yelled across the hall. I froze, and felt the heat rising to my face. My feet were nailed to the ground as everyone stopped to stare at me. There was complete silence in the corridor, and I noticed how some people even held their breath. Darry stalked up to me in enormous strides until our toes were touching and I could feel the condensation of his breath on my nose. His eyes were bright blue and livid. \n \n \n `` Good, because you're not my type.'' I said meekly, thinking I was going to get it anyway, so I had nothing to lose by having a small victory. And I was right. He punched me straight in the nose and sent my head flying back towards the metal lockers, before it bounced off again and I fell forward scattering around the floor. I lifted my hand to see that it had been stained by sticky red blood. I studied the ground as if it was the most fascinating thing I'd ever seen, as Darry leaned down to whisper in my ear: \n `` Do n't be smart with me.'' He said. \n \n ******** \n That night, I lay awake, my nose throbbing with pain. It had been bandaged and I had taken pain killers but the mental wounds would be with me for years. And Darry was not someone who would be likely to forget my small act of defiance. It's not exactly because he has a fantastic memory, ( as proven by his arithmetic pop quiz scores ) but because he's such a nasty person he'll give any reason to beat someone up. I felt bitter as I thought about the next morning, when he would get to show off his new tattoo. What shit timing to have pissed him off, at the height of his popularity. I shut my eyes and willed myself to drift into sleep, to escape from the world for a little while. \n \n \n ********* \n The day of Darry's birthday was today. I had deliberately chosen to wear a large black hoodie and dark blue jeans to keep myself on the down low. My hood was up and my hands were in my pockets. As I walked through the front gates of the school I could feel a buzz in the air. I kept my head down and my eyes trained on the ground. So, word had gotten out about me. The voices suddenly became deafening and the ground started swaying. What did I do to deserve this? I thought to myself. I hated this attention. I hated all kinds of attention, but the kind I hated most was the kind that included whispers that stopped when you approached people, and that started again once you were out of ear shot. The kind that possessed a tone of gossip that made you feel isolated and targeted in a large group of people. I had looked at the ground so hard that I accidentally bumped into someone. I looked up to apologise, but the guy had n't even noticed me. He was too busy staring ahead of himself. And he was n't the only one either, because a whole group of people had gathered with their mouths agape, with a few whispers echoing through the crowd. As I followed their line of sight, I saw it and knew. I knew then that the whispers I heard were not about me. I had clearly overestimated the buzz that I could generate, because, right in front of me, walking with shoulders stiff down the hall, \n \n \n was a red faced Darry, with a massive tattoo of a dick that spanned the entire width of his face.\n"}

She's tired. We all are. \n \n Time passes as the moon moves through the clouds. Yuri sighs, curling his fingers through his beard. We both wait for Anna to continue, but she just stares into the fire, saying nothing. \n \n I lean forward. `` Why are the angels dying?'' \n \n Anna smiles again, her eyes meeting mine. Her pained look. Feigned ease masking despair. `` I do n't know.'' \n \n Anna Sokolov is known as the Harbinger, the Merciful Rain, the Commandant of the Archangels. An officer in her own right, she is seen as less of a soldier and more as a superweapon. Within her flows the blood of a harken, a conjurer of angels. \n \n I have seen the Harbinger repel an Asmodean ambush in a blaze of light and fire. I've seen her descend upon strongholds, the wings of her angels radiant against the evening sky. Seeing her take the field swelled my heart and filled me with hope. \n \n The look on Anna's face somehow makes the wind colder. \n \n `` I do n't know.'' She repeats, and her eyes trail away from mine. `` But they're leaving.'' Anna watches as the winter winds play with the fire. But they're leaving me. \n \n Harkens have always spoke to angels. They do not know what it is like to sleep alone, to be without the presence. To them, angels are siblings, older brothers and sisters who have been with them since the beginning. \n \n And now Anna is alone, with no one but the last of the regiment to keep her company. \n \n Yuri shivers, takes another drink to numb himself against the cold. I study the lines on his face. A man in his late thirties with the footsoldier sigil on his arm. I have always avoided him; something about his stature, his silence, drew me in any direction but his. \n \n Strange we are the only survivors. Strange that I survived all. \n \n `` I heard news from the men in the valley,'' Yuri breaks the silence as he adds another log to the fire. `` They're stranded. Said their harken was killed. That his angles never came.'' \n \n He brings his flasket to his lips and empties it, brushing the moisture from his lips. `` Without angels you have to pay with men. And against Asodeans, the price is very, very high.'' \n \n `` So they wo n't be coming to get us?'' \n \n Yuri frowns at me and I look away, worried that he can see the fear on my face. `` No,'' Yuri continues, `` They will not move to finish the maneuver. Ulus-kert remains devil territory.'' \n \n I look at Anna. A pause, and then she reaches into her coat. Her hand comes out enclosed over something. She clasps it, her knuckles white. A second passes, and she lunges, the fire licking her fingers as she thrusts the object into the fire. I widen my eyes to catch a glimpse of what it was, but in an instant it is nothing more than the kindling beside it. \n \n Anna leans back, her head resting on the cold ground below her. `` Kill the fire,'' She pulls her coat tight and turns on her side. `` We need to hide in the dark.'' \n \n \n\n"}

Even before blood began to mix with the rainwater in the street, some anonymous body snatched up the reflective, thin box before sprinting off into the chaos. \n \n Natty watched from her makeshift home in a garbage-laden stoop that led up to flats stacked high enough to break the clouds. Unnoticed, she crouched, her own precious foil hidden under a knit wool cap, her signs of warning trampled down in the madness. She shifted as the wind picked up, merciless in its frigid bite. She could not hear the bones snapping under her heel, though the feeling was unmistakable. Grimacing, she used a corner of her cardboard sign to brush away the pigeon carcass, its chest now caved in, blood running from the small holes in its beak. \n \n The birds had started falling from the sky three days ago, splattering over rooftops and umbrellas, windshields and prams. Crows, doves, finches- they all simply dropped. It only took an hour for the skies to bleed avian, drenching the manicured town in a macabre display of feathers and gore. \n \n It had to be some solar event, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association proclaimed, attempting to settle the global population down. America, Mexico, India, Iran... only the poles were unaffected. \n \n Natty cried that day. \n \n She'd endured the heckling for years. Teenagers would wad up the now precious wafer-thin tin and toss it at her for sport. Community outreach constantly stopped their van and urged her to come with them to the shelters where the wireless internet flowed, where with microwaves heating cups of noodles while countless people chattered on cellular phones. She could see it all; the rings of signals humanity did not yet understand, crashing into their bodies like waves on the shore, relentlessly shredding precious particles of their DNA. They'd wanted her to take pills. Hateful little tablets of compressed white powder to counteract her brain's tendency to conspiracy and paranoia. \n \n Even when the bees faded out, dead in their apiaries, tiny striped bodies littering gardens and sidewalks, translucent wings gone still though they still caught the light of the sun, no one listened. It was the pesticides, surely. The entomologists were on it, not to worry. A tougher hybrid was being genetically manufactured, and while the crops might suffer that year, there was no need for panic. \n \n Natty had collected as many fuzzy little bodies as she could find, filling an old jar with them and burying them in a community lot. A uniformed officer had stopped her as she lay a stone over the hole she'd dug with her hands, the damp earth still clinging to the underside of her fingernails. `` Move along,'' he'd warned her, oblivious to the catastrophe happening around them. \n \n There was no officer now. \n \n She pressed her back to her little corner where she'd blended in for years, watching the growing pool of crimson black blossom around the young woman who's fingers curled like dead spiders to the grey sky. She pulled her blanket tighter around her shoulders, looking up at the analog clock still powered by kinetic gears, ticking away the time. \n \n Just like the little bird she'd moved aside, a thin bead slipped from her nose. \n \n It would n't be long now. \n \n\n"}

They like to keep all the adolescents in an institution, to stop them from feeling at an early age. Make sure they never learn to care about emotions. I stumble to the kitchen and try to make breakfast without using any ingredients that have hurt people. All the agriculture was long ago dominated by a chemical warfare company that makes deadly poisons; but I still like the ritual of trying to assemble a meal in which the majority of the foods were not farmed in a way that poisons everything and does n't use slaves. Getting harder and harder as time goes on. \n Just about everyone is a slave. All the big sellers and makers that keep the world going rely on people not caring about their own happiness. The slaves do n't mind though, for the most part. Everyone does what they hate, but they get their daily allowed pleasure doses from the hand-held-thought-distraction-devices, so they do n't care. They all keep themselves occupied. \n I'm dressed and ready to go. I have to wait and get picked up by the death-fume machine. Years ago someone invented a machine that burns ancient minerals to generate chaos by taking people place so fast and out of control that sometimes they die along the way, and so they do n't have to look at the world as they go through it. The institution likes to use these to heard us there and back. \n Once I'm there I get to try to fit in safely among my peers until training starts. I learned years ago to just give up on getting them to have compassion. We are in a large brick walled room, hospital sterile, and everyone is sitting around tables. Each person likes knowing that others know how much hate they are filled with. They all chatter about how much pleasure they deserve, and how best they can manipulate others to get it. Training begins. \n For the next seven hours, I go from small room to small room, where group of about 20 adolescents sit in rows of steel chairs, and silently listen to the various trainers. Today they tried to teach us about how to take books that people used to express feelings, and find ways of making us not care by treating the words like a mathematical exercise instead of feeling them. I actually like feeling the books sometimes though. They are from the age when people did n't have distractions. They also taught us about how to negotiate our slavery with toil-paper. It's special certificates that people circulate in the millions that keeps track of how much misery one has given one's self, so they can exchange the work for someone else being miserable. People try really hard to stay slaves, so they can keep getting more toil-paper and making others stay salves. \n I mostly try to tune out the trainers, and they do n't seem to mind. I like to sit and keep my little feelings fed with morsels of lonely memories. It's a good use of my time. I just have to make sure I do n't let myself feel too much, or else it makes the trainers keep me in the institution longer in special rooms where the feelers have to sit in silence until they learn to not feel any more. If that does n't take your feelings away, they send you to secret building where people give you drugs that make your feelings go away. I try to tune out trainers as best as I can. \n When I get home, I try to ignite feelings in other people my age. Some of them spend more time than most just staring at the distraction-devices, and some of them like to pair up and mash at each-other's genitals, so neither of them have to feel. I'm usually too tired from the training all day to really get my feelings going, especially on people who fear them at this point, but I try to do it as best as I can. \n At the end of the day, I often try to calculate how many slaves died because of what I did. The number is usually in around the tens, when I really consider all the possible depths of the question. I do a lot of things that rely on the slaves killing themselves. I ca n't avoid those things any more. \n At night, after trying not to spend too much time on the mind-distracters, I try to remember what it was like to be a child. I ca n't remember. All I feel is lonely. I wonder why I do n't leave all the slaves and go live in the woods. I guess having no company but slaves makes you a bit of a slave too.\n"}

We don ’ t know why our Earth doesn ’ t rotate like the others, but we", "human": "Two halves of the Earth, separated by light and darkness. We don ’ t know why our Earth doesn ’ t rotate like the others, but we make do with what we have. A lot of the population stays along the edges where the two points meet. We call it the Equilibrium ridge. \n You rarely see anyone beyond those unless they survive the vast tundra created by the darkness. A cold, harsh everlasting winter that brews on forever. Never knowing what the warm kiss of the sun feels like. Winds can get pretty brutal out there. Mountains riddle the place and create chasms of frozen wonderlands. If the cold doesn ’ t get yeah then don ’ t worry, other things will be so to get you. Creatures adapted for the cold darkness. Warm blooded by nature with no eyes. Claws to survive the ice. If hell had frozen over, then those demons would surely be there. It ain ’ t hard to survive out there as long as you got the right gear. Simple lights, such as lanterns, keep away the nightmarish demons. \n We don ’ t know exactly what ’ s out there, the darkness gets thicker and thicker as you go in. Like a fog that won ’ t quit, you will get lost out there. There ’ s always someone foolish enough to go try but we never see them again. They either get lost out there or they some unfortunate snack for a demon. \n On the bright side, it might as well be the surface of the sun. The place is covered in nothing but sand. It ’ s easier to live out there because the heat does wonders to ya. As long as you have some nice supply of water, then you ’ re good to go. No one directly lives on the sand, they just build high rises above, no more than five feet of the ground. The sand is just too hot to live on and the creatures can always surprise ya. The surface is even too hot for them. So they adapted to burying under the sand. These are different than their counter parts on the other side of the world. These are nothing but insects. The weaker ones reside near the Equilibrium ridge. They get bigger as you go deeper into the sand pit. It ’ s hard to say how bug cause they usually stay underground a majority of the time. It ’ s hard to tell how they even survive out their due to them being sub terrain an ’ all but man would it be a sight to see. \n The Equilibrium ridge is a nice combination of the two. A place where life finds a way. Plant life is able to grow due to it being a natural river formed by the melting of snow from the tundra. The water softens up both sides of the land so then soil is able to be formed. That ’ s where life started beginning on this place. Life for us mostly resides along this eternal river. Watermills run along it, farming the energy from its strong flow. Houses on the sand pit side are open. Made with simple tree branches so that it has calm warm and earthy feel to it. Letting in the warming touch of the sands. Houses on the tundra side are small and sturdy little domes. Made of rocks found to make it sturdy. They are made for much other than sleeping when we grow tired. They ’ re only big enough to fit a small family and a fire to keep it warm. The more luxurious houses are further from the edge where space isn ’ t as scarce. Food consist of grains that we grow and whatever we catch from the tundra. Hunting in the sand is useless as trying to stabbing the ground with a spear and hopping that you don ’ t hit a rock. \n\n"}

Criticism is appreciated. \n \n I awake with a jolt. My head feels like it's being squeezed, my hands and feet tingling just beyond the ankles and wrists, and my throat feels like when the sandpaper is itself is sanded smooth. After a few second, a wave of hunger rushes on top of me and shook me to full consciousness. \n I do n't know where I am, but I know I'm hungry. Time to find food. A bagel sounds awesome right now. Oh, milk and cookies. I could kill for that. Maybe I'll call mom for lunch. Oh well got ta get up either way. \n \n... The heck?? I ca n't move. Hmm try again. Paralysis? No, my fingers can move around. My toes. I can contract my abdominal muscles. \n \n Looking down I discover the reason I ca n't get up. Ahhh, this also explains the numbness on my joints and cranial pressure. I'm in a metal chair with secure wrist, ankle and head braces. Someone does n't want me to get up. \n Hm. Well.. This ca n't be good. All white walls. Tiny room. Nothing around me. Just me, my chair, and a little triangle thingy, like on the one dollar bills. \n \n Let's think back. Let's try and remember the events heading up to this... Just think Jonathan. \n \n Thinking, thinking- oh. Snap. \n \n It feels like a mind punch. In the small window of two seconds it ALL comes flooding back. And not like you'd think. Everything- from getting pushed down the treehouse ladder by my cousin when I was five years old to my 21st birthday party and graduation last Saturday- came back. All my memories. Every last bit. All at once. It's like asking for the definition of impervious and getting a dictionary dropped on your lap. And now I guess I need to sort through the dictionary and find that word. \n \n So I guess I'll start at Yesterday. Any context has to help- Yesterday.. \n - \n Breakfast was Texas toast and scrambled eggs. The way the toast is crisped, it kinda looked like a silhouette of trees against morning fog. Hey- The eggs can be the sunrise! I arranged the eggs as if the sun is just kissing the horizon, saying `` almost time to wake up!'' \n \n Outside it looked the same. The frost on my window warned me that it could be cold, but the sky says potential. The grass was glistening with fresh whorefrost and seems to be winking as it sparkles in the developing light. Today's was gunna be awesome, I already knew. The eggs were a softer texture than normal, but not undercooked. It's actually a pretty good clash of textures with the toast. Pretty wonderful. Reaching for the Orange juice, my finger slipped slightly, tipping the glass off balance. It's like slow-mo. The glass falls down and shatters, splattering the oh everywhere. The floor, the oven, the trajectory of it even launched it onto the counter. Crap. Well, let's find a napk - \n - \n I snap back to my confinement. It's like I've been in another dimension almost. I was reliving yesterday, down to my emotions! How even! Am I going insane? Now I'm panicking crap. Okay, let's focus on yesterday night. Flipping the metaphorical pages is harder than it sounds, trust me. \n \n Okay. Last night. \n - \n I was about to go to bed. Pajama pants, silky tank top, ambiance going, check check check. The bed looked wonderful.. I think I'll catapult into it. \n \n Plop! Ding dong! \n \n The heck? That's not how this works. Maybe my ear's just ringing. The covers are so cozy, of my gosh. I pulled them over. Perfect- ding dong! Dude, what is.. The doorbell! Rushing over to the door, I found that my friend is there, an unsettled expression plastered across her face. I swung open the door and hit my left toe, in the process cracking my nail. \n `` Oh God! Gahhhh! Come in! Geez! Ouch!'' \n `` No, you come to the car.. Once you're foots okay.'' \n `` Um. GAHH! Teh! Uhh, okay? Wh-OUCH...why?'' \n `` Just come.'' \n \n Her face had been somber this entire time, something had to be wrong. She'd usually be laughing at me and come grab some chips without an invitation needed. This was bad. \n \n Sitting down, toe wrapped in a cold damp towel ( I know nothing medically ), she said nothing and starts driving. It's almost solely silent. The noise cancellation of her car exaggerated it- and never being one for awkward silences, I decided to speak up. \n \n `` So. Um. What's up?'' No response. \n `` Kaeile?'' Still no answer. \n `` You're creeping me out. What is going on.'' \n \n After a long pause, I heard her open her mouth. I look over, but her mouth is n't open; weird. But then, another voice. Soft spoken, African American. It did n't startle me, but my head jerked to the backseat anyways. A huge black dude in a suit meets my gaze. \n \n `` Do you know what you are?'' \n \n `` Excuse me?'' I caught a glance at Kaeile, trying to determine if this is a safe situation. She keeps her gaze on the road. \n \n *ahem* `` Do you KNOW who you ARE?'' \n \n `` N-no sir. I mean. I'm a male. My name is Jonathan. Jonathan Filler. But aside from that sure I do n't I suppose. Maybe I do n't get the question.'' \n \n `` How do I say this.. It's all a lie. Everything.'' \n \n `` What are you talking about. Not tracking, sorry.'' \n \n `` She's not Kaeile. Her name is Amanda Pileon. She is a federal agent, trying to make it all seem like it's real life. Looks like it worked.'' \n \n `` Whatever-'' \n \n `` -And this whole city is agents. Developing a weapon.'' \n \n `` Oh yeah? And what's that weapon.'' \n \n `` You.'' \n \n `` Um. Sure. Okay. Why should I believe this?'' I'm looked to stall time. I needed out of this car. \n \n Kaeili flipped out a wallet. Inside it shown. She really is. Her name is Amanda. \n \n `` What the f***. What the f***. Let me out.'' I just wanted to run. It was n't a lot to go off of, just her ID and this big black dude, but it seems like so much. I just wanted out. It's like Matrix or something. Except not cool anymore. It's freaking petrifying. My palms were sweating, I was visibly shaking. I began to bang on the windows like a monkey in a zoo cage. I guess this is a lot like they must feel. I just want out. \n \n I felt a prick in my neck. This was too much. I ca n't do this. I need to get out. \n \n I opened the car door and straight run. Stumbling out, followed directly my Kaei- Amanda and big black guy. Amanda grabbed my foot. I filled with rage suddenly, remembering all the times we had together. I was going to marry her I though. Sure we were n't a thing yet. But we would be. Should be. Tumbling to the ground I nailed her with my fist. Blood immediately splatters on my hand. I feel it. \n I began to feel like I could pass out at any time. A tranquilizer. They must have got me in the neck with a tranquilizer. Well if I'm going, wherever I'm going, I want to go there with the image of triumph. I want to see the blood plastered on her, with her face twisted in pain. \n \n I turn. Oh God. Her face was twisted, but not in pain. She was bawling, crying, clinging to me to get you down. `` I want out too'' she says, her face splatter painted with my rage. I do n't know what to think. She is still pulling me down, still detaining me, but I feel, physically, emotionally, her compassion. `` I'm so sorry, Jonathan. Forgive me.'' \n \n Darkness. \n \n Snap. \n \n Back in the chair. \n \n It hits me. The weapon. This memory. This superhuman memory. This curse. I'd never realized it before! Were they mulling me? Developing me? Allowing it to haunt me now that I'm out of their confined lifecycle? \n \n How will they use it? What's gunna happen to me? How am I doing this. So much unknown. So much doubt. I burst out in tears- it feels ridiculous, crying while plastered to a chair. It feels hopeless. \n \n Maybe it all is hopeless. I wish it'd just end. \n \n I do n't want this. I want it gone. Whatever comes after death, it has to be better. I do n't have any friends- anyone. I do n't have anyone. Anything. I know nothing, really. What's even real? What- \n \n The door opens abruptly. People pour in. Another sharp neck pain. Tranquilizer? I'm out.\n"}
{"prompt": "`` What do you mean'in love'?'' \n `` I mean in love, Michael, have you forgotten the concept? Need I remind you of the", "human": "`` What do you mean'in love'?'' \n `` I mean in love, Michael, have you forgotten the concept? Need I remind you of the several nephilim who to this day wander the Earth bearing a striking resemblance to you?'' I swear, sometimes the higher ups play dumb just to make things difficult for the average working angel. \n `` I know what falling in love is, Zirdiel, I do n't need your sarcasm. I'm just giving you a chance to explain yourself''. \n I had done it again, upset the archangel. \n `` I do n't know how else to explain it. Emmanuel and, you know, the other one, have fallen in love and are right now living together''. I said, keeping the most un-sarcastic tone possible, it does n't pay to anger the bosses too much. \n `` Jesus Christ! ``, Michael exclaimed, then tensed as the shocking pain of taking His name in vain ran through him. \n `` Yep, that's the one, and also the other, you know'', I said pointing down. \n Michael shot me a killer glance, which had I been a human would have killed me. \n `` Just to be clear, we're talking about Emmanuel and the Anti-Christ''. Said Michael. \n `` Yes!'' I hurried up to say, then caught myself when I realized that for some reason the notion of Emmanuel in love with Lucifer sounded much more disgusting, like a niece with her uncle in human terms. And apparently, going by his expression, Michael shared the feeling. \n `` The Boss is not going to like this'', the archangel said. \n `` The guy downstairs wo n't be happy either'', I said. \n `` How would you know that?'' \n Damn, he caught me. During my years watching over Emmanuel's incarnation in Her Twentieth to Twenty First Century, I had made contacts. The other side was also constantly spying on Her, doing their oppo research, and you get to know the people doing your same job but for the enemy. In this case however, I had gotten even more familiar with Belchor, the demon in charge of looking after Lucifer's Daughter, Princess of Darkness. We had shared surprise to find ourselves in the same city so early on during the prologue to what was supposed to be the End Times, then shock to witness the undeniable chemistry between the two girls, then an uneasy alliance given the fact that, with them living together, we had too see each other all the time. \n `` I've heard the peons of the Legion talk about it'' I told Michael, leaving out details. \n `` Deceit!'' the archangel's voice boomed. `` Surely this is trickery by the Enemy, it's their plan to...'' then his voice faltered. To what? He could n't say it, could he? The Enemy's plan to seduce the Daughter of God, to corrupt Her, to deceive Her? That's not supposed to be possible, She ca n't be deceived, corrupted or seduced, She's perfect. \n And of course She hand't been, deceived I mean. She had been the first to know who Her counterpart was. She had, though, allowed Herself to be seduced, the other girl had had no chances, by the time the Princess of Darkness had realized what was really going on and that she was n't actually corrupting anyone, she was clearly madly in love with Emmanuel. \n `` Yeah no, the opposition was freaking out just as much as you- as we are'' I said. I had been freaking out, at first, but after that I had n't been able to put into words what I was feeling. Because what I had been feeling was the need to continue basking in the warm fuzzy glow of the girls' love, like a cat on a windowsill in a summer afternoon. Belchor had felt the same, which explained why we had taken so long to report the events. Now Belchor was gone and I could not keep the secret any longer. \n `` He should have never made the Earth off limits to His direct gaze'', rumbled Michael, his sword hand was already twitching. \n `` Yeah, I agree with that, but He did and unless He's planning to break the Rule of Causality, what's done is done. So, what now?'' I asked, watching that sword hand nervously. I could totally see Michael going to do something stupid. \n `` We must tell Him, of course''. \n `` Well, since *you're* going to tell Him, might was well tell Him the girls are planning to get married'', I said, putting all my emphasis on'you' and hoping the rest would keep him from noticing I was not offering myself to go up there to give those news to the Big Boss. \n After Michael was done convulsing over the next stream of swearing, we just sat there, I keeping my wings neatly folded so that my superior could let his spread. \n `` I ca n't tell Him that'', said Michael, staring into the distance, archangels can really stare into the distance, their gaze is positively many worlded. \n `` Do you remember the earthquake last week?'' I asked. \n `` What? Yes, what about it''. \n `` That was when the guys downstairs told Lucifer. Belchor told me, he's the demon who was watching over the Princess of Darkness by the way, he told me he was going to Pandemonium to tell his boss about it. After that the earthquake happened and I have n't seen Belchor again...'' I left my words hanging, we both new the likely fate of a demon who gave Lucifer unwelcome news. \n `` The Enemy found out first then?'' Michael asked, tensing. My neck felt very exposed, his sword looked very sharp. \n `` Yeah, but, what was he going to do anyway? It's not like he can harm Emmanuel, and believe me, She would n't allow Lucifer to harm Her beloved''. I hoped the implication was clear that She also would not allow some archangel to harm Her Princess of Darkness. I may not actually like Michael, but I did n't want to see him blinking out of existence. \n `` And besides the earthquake, Lucifer indeed has done nothing''. Michael's expression was changing and I realized what he was thinking, maybe he could sell this as a good thing. \n `` I suspect he's been very angry, down there, but no outwardly action has been taken'', I agreed. \n `` Last time the Big Boss was angered, things did n't went well for this world''. Michael was testing the outer edges of the scenario. There's one thing I can say for him, the archangel really likes humans, human women particularly, there really are several nephilim walking the Earth who resemble him a lot. \n `` Well, last time He was angry with the humans. This time He ca n't blame them''. \n Michael shot me a sideways glance which told me `` oh yes He very much can, omnipotence works in several ways'', but said nothing. After all, God was n't supposed to directly strike the Anti-Christ down during the End Times scenario, and directly wiping out the whole of Creation, which was always a last chance possibility, would mean destroying the relationship His Daughter was in and since She was, well, His Daughter... what? What then? He probably could do it, but She was His Daughter; was n't She also, well, Him? Trinity logistics are tricky even for angels. \n `` You can stay here, Zirdiel, I'll go tell Him, and if you're still aware of existence after a day, we will probably- Creation will probably be fine''. I felt like hugging the archangel, but I just nodded. He knew this could be his last act and he was n't ordering me to stand next to him before the wrath of the Lord.\n"}

Any change since you started?'' Dan's mother asked in her tremolous voice, searching for any clues on my face, and i could sense she was desperate for a positive answer. \n \n `` Mrs. Keen uhmm..The thing is..''

So please if you feel nothing is working out, please dont waste any of our time and our son's time.'' \n \n I took a deep sip of the hot cocoa trying to hide my nervousness as i watched the unfolding argument between husband and wife. My sympathy for Dan overwhelmed me as i saw the standard of family he was growing up in. The disconnection between his parents was a strong indication of the source of their son's troubles. \n \n Dan had difficulty getting along or holding even the simplest of conversations with his peers. He would distance himself at the slightest hint of a start of s conversation. His most valued assets were his Superdude action figures and his huge collection of Superdude comic books. Apart from that, all he did was curl in his bed or stare out of his bedroom window. \n \n `` Steve, let me escort you into his room.'' Mrs. Keen politely suggested with a visibly forced smile shadowed with her tears. She put back into place a grey wisp off hair that had fallen on her face as she directed me into the hallway. Her husband went back to reading the newspapers sports page as he took a huge swig from his silver whisky flask. \n \n Lydia, but as i called her Mrs. Keen out of professional courtesy, led me through the mahogany floored corridor, all the while my eyes darting around the furnished walls, admiring the exquisite pieces of art. \n \n `` Its a shame the person who we worked all this for ca n't even have the time to enjoy them,'' She broke the silence, the crack in her voice betraying her years of sadness and frustration. My mind searched for a reply but it came short. I had nothing to say to her, nothing that would change her situation or make her feel any less helpless. \n \n As we approached the bedroom, i took a small pause to adjust my Superdude costume cap. I let out an audible nervous sigh as she slowly opened the door. \n My eyes adjusted at the dimness of the room as i stared at a figure sitted in a corner. \n \n `` Hey Dan, remember me?'' My voice crackled, trying to adjust to the unorthodox situation, as its not everyday you get to be an imaginary friend to a 30 year old man.\n"}

Close knit tribes could", "human": "At first, the Great Reshuffling was quite perplexing. Some people ended up far better off, some people far worse. Close knit tribes could suddenly be fractured by great distances, and it was quite alienating on the whole. Many people committed suicide, others engaged in hedonistic sprees, but after the initial shock the greater part of humanity just kept calm and carried on. \n \n It was a very confusing time for all. The Scientists never discovered how the Great Reshuffling actually occurred, much less why. The *Social* Scientists declared that, by bizarre circumstance alone, we had experienced Rawls' Original Position, for no one had any say in the matter as to whose body they would now come to inhabit. The Social Scientists theorised that humanity would now come to be much more just, much more fair, and that things like tribalism and racism would simply wipe itself away. Unfortunately, it was not so, as we discovered just how shallow we really are: identities were amorphous and it was not uncommon to see a castigated minority reshuffled into the body of a racial majority and continue to enjoy, and maintain, the same system of privilege that had oppressed his former people. \n \n Lovers could suddenly be brothers and sisters, or vice versa. Families were lucky if they were suddenly scattered across the same town, somewhat lucky if it was the same continent, and if they were plum out of luck they would simply never see each other again. New families arose, but that begat an identity crisis compounded unto infinity. \n \n What was really interesting was when, by sheer determination and will or by luck and circumstance, that the Reshuffled would be able to figure out where their Original Bodies had gone and met who now inhabited them. Sometimes it was a simple affair: two people who had simply traded lives. Usually, with just a bit of talking, both would come to terms with the permanent change in the state of affairs, and with each other. Friendships formed this way were called `` Empathic Bonds'' by the Social Scientists whereas in common parlance it would be much more intuitive: `` Oh, yeah, that's the guy I switched with.'' Nonetheless, it was a pretty intense experience. The tragedy was that so many of these dyadic Reshuffles never found each other, for as simple as it was for just one of the two to stay put and let the other find them, the immediate instinct was always to go looking for your old body, your old home, what was familiar: what you knew. \n \n This was only more complicated with triads and tetrads, which were manageable, but when you had hopelessly complicated networks of Reshuffles then the chances of finding who your body belonged to, or finding your own body, would be next to impossible. The Scientists had estimated up to 10,000 people could be linked together in one big Reshuffle-a-roo, but of course, when it came down to it, not enough people actually bothered to find their bodies. Too many people relished the new freedom found. \n \n It was liberating. All your past burdens, past woes, they were gone. So too did your joys, but then the new burdens and new woes would only crop up if you let them, at least, if you were fortunate in the Reshuffle. Allowed to start afresh, many people decided never to rejoin the world, and to live the rest of their lives as vagabonds, away from the new, evolving society. \n \n The catastrophic failing of institutions with this splintering of teams was actually, quite underwhelming. Humans are a resourceful lot, and the right person always showed up in the right place at the right time, sometimes it might take over a hundred people to get that person there, but it always happened. \n \n The toughest aspect was adjusting gender. Many who were caught in the tough circumstance of having to accept this change resisted it, and it brought a lot of psychological torment. Age was difficult too. Young adults finding themselves in the bodies of the senile would quickly perish, while the opposite led to quite interesting behaviours: when they never expected to get to say `` You Only Live Twice'', they were seized with an overwhelming sense of invincibility and recklessness. \n \n In the end the event went down as just a curious incident in the annals of time, as within a couple of generations things were just as they were: you are you, and I am me. It gave credence to the idea of a transcendent consciousness, that the lines drawn between egos was a fine line *purposefully* drawn, that there's really nothing separating us. It was true before the Great Reshuffling, it was true after the Great Reshuffling and it continued to remain true: \n \n We are we.\n"}

Are you still awake?'' \n \n `` No...'' said the doleful fairy-child, closing tight her eyes into scrunched crow's feet of forced somnolescence. \n \n `` Alfasora.'' A plaintive voice said, and Alfasora opened her eyes to see the smooth, elongated features of her fairy mother, the shimmering pseudo-sky of her bedroom ceiling behind her. \n \n Alfasora sat up and crab-crawled her way toward the headboard of the bed, eyes and face all the while held on her mother throughout the shuffle, and thrust her head back onto the pillow. \n \n `` A story!'' She whispered with wide-eyed urgency, `` a story Mama! About Hearth, with the money men and the sky-machines and the boxes of sound!'' \n \n Her mother laughed and glanced away, taking in the trinket-filled room, with its hanging baubles and gaud-covered walls. \n \n `` A story then, of *Earth*, that's what they call it.'' She said, touching Alfasora on the nose as she corrected her. \n \n `` Caesar! Or Eyes and Hour!'' Alfasora blurted as she tucked her feet under the covers and folded her film-clear wings more comfortably beneath her. \n \n `` Who told you those! Your brother is growing up to be a real imp. No, nothing scary before bed.'' \n \n `` Bu-but!'' She began to protest. \n \n `` No Alfasora, something nice,'' at that Alfasora began to worldessly gawp her mouth in imminent argument, ``... but exciting, I promise.'' \n \n Alfasora wriggled herself slightly in preparation. \n \n `` And with an important lesson.'' \n \n `` Once upon a time, in a far away republic, there was a man named Tre.'' \n \n `` Like, to carry stuff with?'' The semi-fairy's face scrumpled in confusion. \n \n `` No! T-R-E, now listen. \n \n `` On Earth, in his republic, men and women have a different kind of magic. A magic for understanding things and dreaming them different. They look like you and me and your brother - and they talk with words like us too - but they have amazing powers. \n \n They can speak into one rock and make their voice project from another. They can take a view, like of a nice valley or their friend's wedding or a distant castl-'' \n \n `` They have castles!?'' Interrruped the fey child, struggling to reconcile this new detail. \n \n `` They did. Well, they still do, but they do n't make any new ones. Well, they, do but they're not... whatever, it's not important. Their world is strange. Most of all, they can talk, not just with their mouths and ears, but with their eyes and hands.'' \n \n The fairy only appeared more bewildered. \n \n `` They can draw tiny, tiny pictures and when someone looks at the pictures they can hear the artist's voice in their head.'' \n \n The child's eyes were glassy and full of amazement now. `` What do they use it for?'' \n \n `` Gosh, for everything. To say hello, to make rules, to tell each other stories, to keep the things someone said or learned after they die.'' \n \n `` Die?'' asked the child. \n \n `` That's another magic in their world, a strange magic, where a human goes away forever if they do the wrong thing. If they crash while flying or if they eat something that humans ca n't eat.'' \n \n `` Ok...'' Alfasora, unable to suspend disbelief on this detail, urged her to go on. \n \n `` So, Tre, this boy Tre, was from a very poor family, and when he was a little human, his mother died.'' \n \n `` But was she still in the things, the little pictures, what are they called?'' \n \n `` They're called... I think...'weirds' or'wards', and no, you ca n't bring someone back from them if they died. But Tre grew up and was very powerful in human magic, it's called'smart', and he became what they call a'doctor'.'' \n \n `` What powers does a doctor wizard have!'' \n \n `` Well, if something is wrong with a human, they can usually fix it. Do you remember when you scraped your wing on that Snarf? On Earth, a doctor could put a magic spell on it and it would have been better sooner.'' \n \n `` No!'' \n \n `` Yes! And sometimes, if a human has something so wrong with them they might die, a doctor can fix them, and then they wo n't die.'' \n \n `` What!'' \n \n `` Yes. I know. Can I continue?'' \n \n `` Sorry.'' Said the child, and tucked back under her cover, even deeper than before. \n \n `` So, Tre was a special kind of doctor wizard who used magic to save people from exactly the kind of monster that ate his mother.'' \n \n `` What did the monster look like?'' \n \n `` Well, on Earth, they do n't really have monsters like we do, even mean humans are n't monsters, but this thing is like a monster. It's an invisible monster called a'disease'. And sometimes if the monster gets you, it will get anyone you touched. Or sometimes, it will get anyone you even came close to. Or sneezed on. But some of the worst monsters, wo n't go for everyone you're close to, some monsters will just come after your children. And their children. And their children.'' \n \n `` Mommy! *You* said not a scary one!'' \n \n `` Sorry, right, well, diseases do n't eat fairies, they do n't like us. But on Earth, they eat people. And the same disease that ate Tre's mommy was going to eat Tre. This monster is invisible. You ca n't lock it out of your house. You ca n't escape it. You ca n't touch it or hit it or bite it. It can go wherever you-'' \n \n `` Mommy. This. Is. Scary.'' \n \n `` Ok, hold on, so, doctor wizards, can create special spells to destroy a disease. Before it hurts you or before it even finds you. So Tre used all of his powers to create a spell, all of his'smart' magic, to find the right spell to destroy the disease. \n \n `` But the disease made him weaker, made him slower, made him seem older than he really was. He still had n't found the right spell but he was trying. \n \n `` His friends told him to stop, to just enjoy Earth, to look at picture-weirds and do what Earth-people do for fun. \n \n `` But he did n't, he stayed in his special doctor-magic dungeon called a'labradory'- \n \n `` With the little furry things!'' Alfasora asked, suddenly hopeful. \n \n `` Not always, maybe some do, maybe that's how they got their name, but not this one. This one just had magical potions and wands. He worked day and night, he worked on and on, fighting the disease. \n \n `` One day, his friends went to check on his work, but there was no answer at the door. They knocked. They shouted. They went around to sneak in through a window, when they saw him on the floor, fallen out of his doctor-wizard chair still in his white doctor-wizard robe.'' \n \n `` Why? Was he stuck to the ground?'' \n \n `` No Alfasora, he was dead. He would never finish his spells. He would never laugh with his friends again. He would never get to go to do all the fun Earth things he ever did or all the fun Earth things he never got a chance to do. Even though when they found him his body was all in one piece, when a body dies it slowly falls apart and then just becomes dust and dirt, so on Earth they put friends who die in the ground.'' \n \n `` What happened?'' She asked, very quietly and sadly. \n \n `` The monster, the disease, that made his Mommy die, made him die too.'' \n \n `` So, so,'' the child's voice wobbling and eyes welling, `` so the monster won, he'died'. The disease ate him.'' \n \n `` Shh, shh, it's okay, I'm sorry, I should have picked a better story, wait. This is a human story, this is n't a fairy tale. Tomorrow I'll tell you an Orc story and if you really ca n't fall asleep tonight, I'll tell you an otter story.'' \n \n `` With bees!'' demanded he child. \n \n `` Yes, with otters and bees. But in this story, of Doctor Tre who died from his mother's disease, something amazing happened. Something that only human magic could do.'' \n \n `` He came back!'' \n \n `` No, well, almost, he did die. So he ca n't come back, someone who dies is really gone, really forever. But, the'weirds', the tiny pictures that people use to talk to each other, he left those behind for his friends, and the friends of his friends. \n \n `` So his friends could learn everything that he knew about the disease and help to find spells to save people like Tre from the disease that ate him and his mother. \n \n `` Did his friends do it? Did they beat the disease?'' \n \n `` Not yet, they're still trying. But even if each one does n't quite get the whole thing, another one is ready to take his place, to start where he left off.'Die' is n't the right idea, because he did n't go away forever. All of his magic stayed behind and stayed with his friends. \n \n `` Now in our world, we have murgles and fiefinors and schlabelhunds and snarks, maybe we have different magics and different powers to humans, but you can be just like Tre and, I think, he's just like you. \n \n `` Whatever your magic is, whether it's doctor magic like a human or sugarplum booning like a Hurbottor goblin, you've got to find out what that is and use that to make the world a better, happier place. \n \n `` So no matter what happens, your magic will always be left behind. \n \n `` And maybe your magic is just being as cute as a little fairy button,'' she finished as she kissed the now sleeping fairy girl on a round, rosied cheek. \n \n `` Good night Alfasora, I love you and be a good fairy,'' said the girl's mother as she slipped carefully through the hanging dew-beads in the bedroom doorway and hummed a human tune as she snuck down the stairs.\n"}

Dugan pounded on the table. `` Tell me, what will it take to earn my people the favor of the gods? Will Urist favor us if we build him a temple as great as the dwarves? Does the Forest have a price we can meet for its aid?'' \n \n It was strange to hear the king speak of the gods like it was a business transaction, but having divine favor was an immensely practical matter. A trained cleric could heal the gravely wounded, make the crops grow in a famine, or call down a storm on his enemies. Without magic to protect them, the human kingdom lived on a razor's edge. One bad harvest could mean the death of thousands. The ability to ordain a cleric, to imbue a human with the power of miracles, was worth any price. \n \n `` In every kingdom we traveled to, they say the gods only favor the race they have created. Urist and Gorkamork and Larethian will not aid us, no matter our ritual.'' Prince Viserion said. \n \n `` I tested it, your highness,'' added the spymaster, Tarlok. `` I studied their most secret rites as thoroughly as I could, but no attempt to replicate them succeeded. We can not ordain a cleric, not by any known means.'' \n \n `` Then where is our Creator? Why has he abandoned us?'' \n \n `` The mythology is unclear on that point. Some say our god died long ago. Some say we are just an afterthought of the gods, created as a side project. Some say we sprang from the earth fully formed. We found no good answers on our trip. But we did find one glimmer of hope.'' \n \n `` If you can call it that.'' Viserion shifted uneasily from foot to foot. \n \n `` While we were down in the dwarven tunnels, we met a curious creature, one who said he could supply us with magical power, for a price.'' \n \n `` Oh, just come out and say it. We met a demon, offering a deal.'' \n \n The spymaster waved a hand at the doors, and the guards opened them, to reveal a creature with red skin and horns, dressed in a black uniform. Two batlike wings peeked out above his shoulder blades. \n \n `` You do n't need to be so tasteless about it, Prince Charming.'' The demon replied. `` But yes, I am Zevuv, a demon, and I have a deal that will benefit both of us.'' \n \n `` Father, I would not trust him. We found many legends of demons in our travels, and all of them ended poorly. The power they grant is never worth the price.'' \n \n `` A fair argument,'' said the demon, bowing his head slightly. `` If you were an elf or dwarf, you'd find little to gain from us. But when you're already bankrupt, you can hand over all your money and be no poorer for it.'' \n \n He stepped slightly closer to the throne. `` Your kingdom is on the brink. Orcs and goblins raid your farms, and the elves and dwarves see you as merely a useful buffer state. Your kingdom wo n't survive long enough for your son to take the throne. Any price I ask would be worth it.'' \n \n `` Would it?'' \n \n `` The village of Culver's Hearth was overrun by goblins, and the soldiers you sent after them sank into an enchanted swamp. The drought in the Rolance Valley has gone on for a full year, and it is increasingly obvious that an Elvish hex was responsible. Your kingdom will die, piece by piece, unless you have magic of your own.'' \n \n `` How do you know all this?'' The spymaster asked. `` Were n't you down in the dwarf lands?'' \n \n Zevuv smiled, showing a mouthful of pointed teeth. `` I know it because you know it. A demon's contract works by drawing on your desires, focusing them. When you turn those desires into a contract, your power becomes similarly focused.'' \n \n A circle of bloody red light flared around him. *'' Here are the terms of the contract. Slay the goblin warband in the south. Leave not a single one alive. Your soldiers shall not tire, shall not rest, until the deed is done. `` * \n \n `` That's your price? Something we wanted to do anyway?'' \n \n `` This *has* to be a trap,'' repeated the Prince. \n \n `` No trap,'' said the demon. `` Why demand the blood of your people, when the blood of your enemies will serve just as well?'' \n \n The king rose from his throne, looking the demon in the eyes. Tendrils of red light extended from the demon towards him as he spoke. \n \n `` You have a deal.''\n"}

But for some reason you get no response, whatever it was moved away from you. You hurry along down the hall after what seems to be a person, yet anytime you bump into them they move away. \n \n This time you are catching them and getting an answer. You rush up to where you think they are and start yelling, `` Do you have any idea how rude you are being, I mean come on I'm blind here'' Yet still no response, all you hear is a deep breathing, until it hits you. If you could see lights, your's just went out. \n \n You wake up a few moments later, with a small crowd chattering around, you start to listen to what they say, `` Wow, why did that blind kid get into a fight with the deaf kid?''\n"}

The black stains under its eyes testimony to the fact that he was a stray. With no further bottles spilling down on it, the cat edged forward to finish its meager meal. A sound in the mouth of the alley set the cat to yowling, a low rumble in its chest. The hair on its back stood on end following the agitated arch of its spine. \n \n `` Shoo,'' the woman whispered through her black silky veil. The cat's irritation vanished as it sped away, sensing something no human could ever detect. The woman was otherworldly and dangerous -- terribly dangerous. \n \n She twirled the black parasol resting on her satin-covered shoulder, stepped around the scattered bottles with her zippered knee-high brown leather boots, and watched as the man in black padded down the alley. She raised a scented kerchief to her noise and mopped away the moistness. \n \n `` Your money or your life.'' The man rasped, pulling a long slender blade from his sleeve. She giggled, then teetered, and then laughed a rich throaty sound. The man hesitated. `` Your money or your life.'' He repeated. She was still laughing when he thrust the knife into her chest. She kept laughing and mopped at the brown syrupy blood spilling out from around the blade. She held it up before his confused eyes and jammed the bloody finger in his open mouth. The effect was immediate. \n \n He fell back, staggering and yelling in protest, denying something that could n't be. He slapped at his head screaming -- NO! NO! NO! He tore at his skin with his nails, ripping bloody gobbets of pale skin from the fatty parts of his cheeks. The he froze, quivering in pain and mounting fear and looked up into the face of the woman he'd stabbed. She pulled back her veil... and he screamed. He bounced off the alley walls and glancing backwards at the woman who was n't a woman and fled into the street. He did n't see the truck, and even if he had, he still would have run in front of it. \n \n She raised her hand to her veil intending to lower it when the door to the back of the kitchen suddenly opened. The boy standing in the door, froze catching sight of her face and raised the cross around his neck to his lips. He knew her. She was...\n"}

I asked, incredulous. \n \n `` Just, try it, okay?'' Jane, my sister, asked me. \n \n `` It's a nice thought,'' I said, not really meaning it. `` but-'' \n \n Jane visibly gave up. `` Okay, that's cool, do n't worry about it. Mom and Dad and Beb made me promise to say *something* so now I can say I did, right?'' \n \n `` All three of our parents? Even Beb?'' Of all our parents, I'd have expected Beb to have understood. Had n't ae been in a similar situation aerself? I knew ae had n't married my parents until their mid-twenties, and my parents had been highschool sweethearts. \n \n `` Sorry,'' Jane said, and she meant it. Parents, what are you going to do? \n \n Later that night, I checked it out. And it seemed okay, at first. Modern website, but not in a stuffy corporate sort of way. In addition to its obvious purpose, it had polls, forums, games - basically a social network for the affine-lacking. \n \n And I'd joined the site for maybe an hour, total, before I glanced up at the inbox and saw I had a hundred messages waiting for me. Well,'99+', but if anything that was worse. Of course, I made the mistake of opening those messages. \n \n > Ayy get, wut u up to? \n \n > ayyy get \n \n > ay \n \n And that was the ones that did n't send pictures of their genitalia. Fully half of the messages in my inbox featured a penis or a labia; a few times couples sent both. I even got a few explicit messages from other Affine, even though I'd checked the `` straight-bisexual'' box. \n \n I'd forgotten about this, because I'd been trying very hard to forget about it, and the world did not want to let me. Affine dating was rough: when you're a teenager absolutely nobody wants anything to do with you. Men and women of that age are practically monosexual, because guess what? You ca n't have a child if an affine's not involved. Stereotypes of Affine as homo-monosex pretty much all stem from desperate aff teenagers full of hormones and other-gendered classmates who desperately want to not get knocked up. \n \n Almost immediately after college, that all changes. I went from being a nobody to being talked up by couples constantly. If I was at the bar, sure, it was n't a surprise, but the store? The gas station? Where the hell were all these couples five years ago? \n \n And it only gets worse. Mid-thirties or so, people start getting desperate. The biological clock may or may not be a real thing, but the biological timer definitely is: You've only got so long until you ca n't have kids. I literally could not leave the house for longer than a few minutes without running into someone who wanted a kid. Not even to take a walk! I'd always thought the Green couple down the street were nice, but nowadays they were kinda creepy with they way they seemed to always be watching me. \n \n I closed the damn website. Did n't even bother to delete my account, just blocked the reminder e-mails and tried to forget the entire experience. My parents - even beb! - would bug me again come the holidays, and boy would n't that be fun, but I could at least say I'd tried. Hell, Jane could back me up on that one. \n \n I'd known I was n't actually going to follow through, though. I'd known that relationships were n't for me for a long time. I'd known ever since I'd gotten into that accident in college, ever since the doctors said I'd make a full recovery, but that there were certain long-term complications. And I had n't really realized what that would mean, at the time, but thinking back my doctor had tried to prepare me as best ae could. \n \n Now, though, I knew. Every day a couple made up some excuse to run into me and chat, I knew. Every time someone with only one wedding ring made eyes at me, I knew. \n \n I leaned back in my chair, pet my cat, and sighed, knowing none of that was for me. \n \n What use was a sterile Affine?\n"}

On it, the Taj Mahal evaporated in", "human": "Thirteen Wishes, the Valorian's cultural attaché, hovered closer to the viewscreen. On it, the Taj Mahal evaporated in a stream of ionizing radiation. Beside Thirteen Wishes, the handler hovered, nervously preening a mandible. Separation from the pod-waters gave Six Blue Stones anxiety. \n \n `` They have no idea what they've done,'' whispered Thirteen Wishes. \n \n `` The Candelans have a very good idea what they've done. Every cultural bastion on every public database they could access is gone. Within four minutes of entering orbit.'' \n \n Thirteen Wishes signaled for the viewscreen to pause, and turned to Six Blue Stones. `` Pod-plus,'' Thirteen Wishes said, as it corrected its elder. `` They've awoken a monster, and they do n't know it yet. The humans need their culture. It's what turns them away from atrocity and violence. You're going to have to tell the council to expect atrocity in reprisal. Unsanctionable atrocity.'' \n \n `` I do n't think there'll be much sympathy in the face of Candelan aggression.'' \n \n Thirteen Wishes agitated its antennae-fronds emphatically. `` Pod-plus, there might very well be. Do you remember, playing as a sylph? The push-game, on the ice? Sometimes, sometimes in every pod you have the quiet sylphs that will dig their legs in, near the water. They stop pushing, and start biting.'' \n \n `` I lost a leg until my molt, to one like that,'' Six Blue Stones said. \n \n `` Do you remember how it felt? To be so dumbfounded that someone of your pod would snap back so cruelly?'' Thirteen Wishes asked. \n \n `` I remember,'' Six Blue Stones said, quieting. \n \n `` Well then, you can understand. You should never push the pink-skins to the thin ice. Humans took the chance to see other sentient species as part of their pod. I've spent forty-one cycles on their world, seeing their culture, seeing how they pour the energy of violence into art instead. They're a tribal species, in every level. But their tribality is arbitrary: Family units, extended family unit, then other arbitrary extensions encompassing coloration or landmass, mostly kin-selection enforcement.'' \n \n `` As expected for a k-selecting species,'' said Six Blue Stones. \n \n `` No, not as expected,'' retorted Thirteen Wishes. `` Instinctually, the tribalism instinct is *absolute*, but their psychology allows it to apply it *arbitrarily*. Their entire species is under assault.'' \n \n Six Blue Stones flattened its fronds. `` Cultural assault.'' \n \n `` No, pod-plus. Even if the fatalities are limited, and the Candelans are appropriately avoiding civilian casualties, the Humans wo n't perceive it that way. To them, it's an assault, on their tribe. The Human tribe. Please take my word for it, as your cultural attaché. Right now they are looking to the stars, and they are plotting absolute vengeance. Disproportionate retaliation. The Candelans took away everything, every reason, for the Humans *not* to go to total war.'' \n \n `` Over some cultural artifacts and constructs? ``, Six Blue Stones asked. It was used to trusting Thirteen Wishes, but the extremes that its pod-minus was suggesting seemed hyperbolic, and not at all credible. \n \n `` Yes, pod-plus. Over the soul of their species. I'm not sure they could be made any angrier without every one of their k-selector investment offspring being murdered in front of them. This would be very close on par.'' \n \n `` *Oh*,'' said Six Blue Stones, fronds going a vibrant yellow of fear. \n \n Thirteen Wishes turned back to the viewscreen, and dropped its voice lower. `` Humans turn everything to art and violence, pod-plus. Both. They call fighting techniques'martial arts'. They speak in respectful tones of'the art of war'. Their military officers are expected to have some grounding in the creation of fine arts, as well as military maneuvring. Their warriors go to war to audible art, music. They decorate their carapaces, their clothing, their equipment, with art that means war.'' \n \n Thirteen Wishes turned back to Six Blue Stones. `` The Candelans have never joined art and violence. The humans have never known anything but art-violence. While the Candelans think they're engaging in a polite appropriation of a species through cultural conquest... to the Humans, they've just declared an extinction-level war. Extinguishing human culture will be indivisible to them from species.'' The pod-minus's voice turned pleading. `` Please, do n't let the council block what's about to happen. This is, and should, be treated as an extinction war. That's how the Humans perceive it.'' \n \n Six Blue Stones went yellow from antennae-stem to frond. `` How much threat can they realistically pose to the Candelans?'' \n \n `` In military superiority, under these circumstances? None. But it wo n't matter. I told you, pod-plus, violence and art are indivisible for them. They will do what they have always done, when faced with violence; they will create new ways of it. They'll start with suicide strikes. They'll surprise the Candelans with domestication. See the brief on their'canis familiaris', dogs. Other lower life forms. Sabotage. Destruction and denial of assets and materials. They'll inevitably capture some Candelans. They will *definitely* figure out their biochemistry. Chemical warfare will follow, even chemicals harmful to their biosphere. Fission and fusion weapons. Biological weapons. Informational and memetic weapons. *Everything* they can think of, they will try, pod-plus. *Everything. * Their reprisals will not stop.'' \n \n Six Blue Stones waved a frond, and the viewscreen changed. `` Our satellites indicate they're already boosting drives onto... what are those?'' \n \n Thirteen Wishes examined the small metal cylinders. `` Barrels, pod-plus. Just a welded drive onto a barrel. Scan it.'' \n \n The computer puffed a dose of saline mist into the air in acknowledgment, and the screen changed. \n \n ``... just, biomass. Dirt. What are they hoping to do, sling mud at the Candelan ships?'' \n \n Thirteen Wishes fronds went so yellow they became nearly golden, and then in a voice barely loud enough for Six Blue Stones to hear: `` At the Candelan home world. To violate their biological integrity, their biosphere.'' \n \n `` But that will take hundreds of cycles for it to begin to damage their homewor-'' Six Blue Stones began, and then cut off, aghast. `` They do n't care, do they?'' \n \n Thirteen Wishes agitated its fronds. `` No, pod-plus. They are already *far* past the point of caring. I told you. Atrocity. Extinction. Nothing less. They can make those barrels by the thousands, within a day. A simple drive, sensor package, basic computer, and a barrel of dirt.'' \n \n `` Stop them! We have to stop them!'' \n \n `` We *can't*, pod-plus. We ca n't. This is just the start.'' \n \n They hovered in silence, as fifty-four new barrels arced away from the planet. Most would never survive the journey. \n \n A few would.\n"}

I got beneath the table. Kiefer was still pacing around all smooth. “ Get under here dumbass! ” \n \n The earthquake brought with it weird flashes of the lights. \n \n “ And now you ’ re coming, ” said Kiefer. A dark laugh of a crowd echoed throughout the living room. “ I'm too close to the truth. ” \n \n In flashes, I saw grey visions of men and women in robed attire. Sitting in a circle around us. Like there was an invisible Colosseum from which they watched us. They looked intrigued. \n \n They were beckoning with their hands ‘ come ’. \n \n “ If this is some sick joke, ” I said. “ I swear, I just *swear*. ” \n \n “ He ’ ll soon see you all, ” Kiefer went on bended knee and looked into my eyes. His eyes went white like porcelain.

I shivered beneath the table, then stood up in a fit. My knees were weak. \n I searched all around the kitchen table. I searched every inch of the living room, every inch of every room on the floor, of the house, of my own room. I lifted up the bed sheets covering a pile of pillows. I threw them at the wall. Nothing. \n \n I fell over onto my bed. I shook my head slow and steady. \n \n `` I'm hallucinating.'' \n \n Then I heard that dark laughter of a crowd re-appear. I wanted to cry. \n \n “ *We ’ ll be back for you Christopher*, ” was their unified whisper, before the return to silence. \n \n Later that night, I met my ancestors. \n\n"}

Fear grips a slowly beating heart as he wades into childhood and the smell of cut wood somehow manages to fill his lungs though his nostrils are caked and clotted with blood.

They could not accept him as he truly was, nor could they accept what he was molded into. Though there are those that call him friend, they are lost in a sea of hatred where even he can not tread. Though there are those that call him family, it is they who crowned an unworthy king before even being born and he believed them. Birthed to a star gleaming above superstitious fools and welcomed in a manger to a world not ready for his kind. Before even his birth, they whispered god.

I stared at the clock. *tick-tok. * I looked back at Levi. He was in his fifties, but you would n't know it by looking at him. He looked thirty-five, and was in good health.

We just do n't know. But if I can convince you to join me on this journey, we'll do it together.'' \n \n He held out his hand across the table. I could see the passion in his eyes. I could see his conviction. \n \n *This is for the greater good, * I thought. \n \n I outstretched my arm and grabbed his hand. `` I'm in.'' \n \n I closed my eyes and waited, *we* waited for the moment of truth.

I began to walk down the path laid out before me, in awe of the legendary artifacts that surrounded me. To my left a well polished shield hung on the wall, to my right there was a leather quiver filled with silver tipped arrows. I continued down the ancient corridor, passing many weapons. I remember every last one of them; there was a spear as long as I was tall, a hammer that looked too heavy to be held up by the earth itself. There was a pair of identical daggers, their ancient blades emitting a faint black aura, and there was a scythe with a silver blade that bore the inscription `` My enemies the gods may reap, I merely carry their scythe''. \n \n These items were the tools of the ancient chosen warriors, hidden away in the legendary hall of chosen warriors. Every step I took down the corridor meant giving up the chance to use the weapons I passed, for I must press forward if I hoped to gain my own legendary item. \n \n Eventually I reached the end of the hall and knew which one would lend me its power. On the back wall of the corridor, there were no weapons hanging; instead there lay a sword in a pedestal directly in front of the wall. I recognized the sword instantly, it was my sword; I had forged it with help from my closest friend, who was a skilled blacksmith. How could it be here!? The instant I thought this, a mysterious voice came from my blade. `` A warrior does n't come here to find a new blade, instead they come here to realize that they already have their legendary weapon.'' Without hesitation, I picked up my blade and was comforted by the familiar weight in my hand. With my sword in hand, I turned and left the corridor, ready to take on the darkness that I must face.\n"}

I wo n't feel it, of course, but it will ruin the presentation. \n \n I take similar care with my clothing. I've been preparing for these glorious twenty-four hours for weeks. The first thing I did was pay an exorbitant amount of money to a personal stylist. She helped pick the outfit. \n \n More money went, just yesterday, on spending a ridiculous amount at a salon. Worth it though, just like the personal stylist. I've always wanted to say `` money is no object'' in a shop, so that was a bonus. \n \n I drive carefully too. Again, not for safety reasons, but because it has to be perfect. The car gleams - repainted and cleaned yesterday, while I was getting my first ever pedicure. \n \n I do n't feel anything as I get out of the car and walk slowly up the path. I can feel my heart thumping against my rib cage, can feel my palms moistening, but that's not me. I simply observe the physical response without being affected by it. \n \n Twenty-four hours without feeling. No feeling of any kind. No dull pain from a headache or sharp pain from a cut. No nerves or worry. No joy in sunsets or friends, but that's not the important thing. \n \n It wears off in a day, and then I can feel again. Can have all the sunsets I want. But for these perfect twenty-four hours, I'm free. I've traded a single sunset for the ability to do anything without fear or hesitation. No deep, sucking misery or the agony anxiety. \n \n And so I'm here. Standing in front of the door, preparing myself for something that's always been too painful to do before. \n \n I do n't feel anything as I press the buzzer. I do n't feel anything as she opens the door, and her eyes widen in surprise at seeing me. She's symmetrical, and slim, and rounded - on any other day, I'd drink in the sight of her and feel a rush of longing and a slower burn of confusion and nerves. Today I simply notice, and move on. \n \n I do n't feel anything as I work through my rehearsed speech. There's no twinge of embarrassment as her boyfriend comes and stands behind her, leaning against the door frame. There's no roiling, building fear in my stomach as her expression barely changes with each sentence. There's no unending, piercing pain in my heart as she smiles at me, kindly, and I wait for her answer. \n \n I stand there, my secret thoughts poured out in front of me, and I feel nothing. No pain. No worry. No fear. It does n't hurt to say the words I've been bottling up for years. I do n't feel anything as I bare my soul in front of her, make myself incredibly, wretchedly vulnerable as I tell her how much she means to me, how much her smile has brightened the last three years, how much I have felt for her on every day except today. \n \n She speaks, but she does n't have to. I feel nothing as I gaze into her eyes and see the truth. She feels nothing either.\n"}

For better communication our minds decided to build something organic, described as a constant proportional by the amount of the perception echo called memories. To escape the illusion that takes place one meditates and expresses every happening in the universe as polarity. Our collective location y never changes. Everything happens rather then is stable even though the macroscopic world compels to accept continuity like matter, which itself has a moment in spacetime fabrics. When one moment of environmental polarity to the ego is ceased we will have created a whole coordinate, one organised movement of physical particles. The death of one particle or assembly of memory is an illusion because the background perception in which we superficially controlled our guts heart and lungs etc. We may be able to feel what perception means without this extreme complexity, just following the flow of influence, undefined and cloudy. Finally accepting that death is expressed by the number 0 at end of time we will fill the void of matter in its polarity to the paradox of nothing. 0 contains every number. The occurance of 5 means absence of -5. So the cycle of the universe will end perfectly broaded and goes smoothly over into eXistance=0\n"}
