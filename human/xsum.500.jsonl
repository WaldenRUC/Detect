{"human": "Cryptography was once controlled by the state and deployed only for military and diplomatic ends. But in the 1970s, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised a system which took encryption keys away from the state and marked the start of the so-called \"Crypto Wars\".\nWhitfield Diffie and three other experts spoke to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about the tensions at the heart of the spat between Apple and the FBI.\nIn 1975, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised \"public key cryptography\", which revolutionised encryption.\n\"The basic techniques we used until public key cryptography come from around 1500 in the western world, and were known from about 800 in the Middle East.\n\"They are basically arithmetic. Not ordinary integer arithmetic, but something like clock arithmetic - it's 11 o'clock and you wait three hours and you get 2 o'clock - and table lookups. What's the 5th element in the table? What's the 20th element?\n\"The trouble is you can't do them very well without some kind of mechanical computation. A human being can't do enough of those calculations to produce a secure system without making too many mistakes.\n\"Before what we did, you could not have supported cryptography outside a fairly integrated organisation. If you look at the US Department of Defense, it's very large, but very centralised; everybody knows the chain of command.\n\"They can have a trusted entity run by the National Security Agency (NSA) to manage the keys [used by the military and government]. If you were in the military, and it was part of your assignment to talk to somebody securely in another part of the military, they would supply you with a key, and every morning you come out and put one in your teletype machine or phone or whatever.\n\"But the internet is not just meant for friends to talk to friends, it's for everybody to talk to everybody. Until you have public key cryptography you have no way of arranging the keys on demand at a moment's notice for these secure communications.\n\"That's what browsers do with websites all the time. Amazon, eBay, all of the merchants on the internet encrypt at least some of the traffic you have with them, at the very least the payment portion of it.\n\"[At the time] the NSA reacted like any other enterprise that has had a monopoly in a market for a long period of time. Suddenly somebody was treading on its turf, and it made several attempts to recapture its market.\"\nSusan Landau is professor of Cyber Security Policy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.\n\"Public-key cryptography was mathematically elegant and also quite elementary. That's what made it so powerful and so wonderful.\n\"The NSA said 'Wait a minute: this work should be classified.' They had been accustomed to being the only place that cryptography was done. They didn't want a competitor developing algorithms that maybe they would have trouble breaking into. They wanted to hold the keys to the kingdom.\n\"There was a big fight between the academic and industry research community and the NSA. But it was settled fairly amicably, fairly quickly. The next problem was who would control the development of cryptography standards for the US government.\n\"The NSA does this for military and diplomatic communications, but there's a vast need for cryptography for civilian agencies such as health and human services, education, agriculture. The National Bureau of Standards had been doing this in the 1970s but in the 1980s the NSA began pushing in this direction.\n\"Congress, who had always looked more favourably on the civilian side, put the National Institute of Standards and Technology in charge.\n\"But the law also included this little thing about three people from NSA approving certain things. They exercised tremendous control, and kept blocking standards that were more friendly to the commercial sector. That battle went on between 1987 until the mid 1990s. It was quite ugly.\n\"Another battle was over the clipper chip. Clipper was a very hard algorithm with a secure key, but the key was split and was to be shared with agencies of the federal government. The idea was [that] a business person travelling overseas would be able to use a clipper-enabled phone and talk securely with the office back at home.\n\"But if you're doing something illegal the US government will be able to decrypt easily, because the keys are held by its agencies.\n\"It was a complete flop. Outside the US, no one wanted it. Inside the US, no one bought it. It was a total failure.\n\"The controls on cryptography in the 1990s were very odd because they were controls on an export. If you wanted to export a computer or communications device with cryptography, you needed an export licence from the US government.\n\"Much of the time you would get 'We're looking at it, we'll get back to you.' Of course, when you're selling high tech, you don't need a delay of two months, [so] you decide not to have strong encryption within the device - you put in something very weak that the US government will allow to go without a licence. The effect was to not have strong encryption domestically as well as abroad.\n\"In 2000, the US government loosened the controls on export of devices with strong encryption; it looked as if the private sector won the battle.\"\nAlan Woodward is an expert in signals intelligence, intelligence gathered from communications, who has worked for the UK government in various roles.\n\"Suppose you got intelligence that people appeared to be mobilising their military forces. You'd need to know whether that was a prelude to war, or just an exercise. One of the ways to do that was by analysing the signals and communications traffic going around on the other side.\n\"In the early 2000s, it got harder. Previously they'd had the ability to decrypt things that were weakly encrypted. You could throw a super computer at the problem and try all the possible keys until you unlock the message.\n\"You just physically couldn't do that for the number of encrypted messages that were starting to pile up. But also, the forms of encryption were becoming stronger. The encryption that was being used by governments themselves back in the 1970s was called the Data Encryption Standard. With a modern PC, you can break that in a matter of seconds. That kind of evolution in encryption and decryption has been going on ever since.\n\"It got worse because there were various other forms of technology that were based on encryption, where you were able to remain anonymous, completely hidden. There's a thing called the Tor network which causes security agencies a great deal of trouble, because you don't even know where that person is based, never mind who they're communicating with.\n\"Governments recognised that there wasn't a lot you could do about this technically or from a policy perspective. It's out there. So what you have to do is  be able to get at it before it is encrypted or after it's decrypted.\n\"They recognised that they needed to work more closely with the technology providers because they were the ones that owned the infrastructure that was being used.  They were the ones running it; it was no longer governments and state telecommunications companies.\n\"They had very good relationships. Microsoft produced a suite of software called Cofee (Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor), which is only given to government and Law Enforcement Agencies. It's a forensic tool that allows you to analyse Windows systems.\n\"You used to be able to go along to Apple and they could unlock the phone. With messaging services it was possible for governments with the right authorisation to go along and sit in the middle of the conversation and look at the messages in a non-encrypted form.\n\"All of that changed when Edward Snowden got his leaks out.\"\nJeff Larson is a reporter at New York investigative newsroom ProPublica. It worked with the Guardian newspaper on the sensitive material leaked by Edward Snowden from the US National Security Agency in 2013.\n\"I had seen something in the Snowden tranche of documents that made me suspicious that the NSA and GCHQ had been working behind the scenes to crack encryption that powers internet technologies.\n\"When you log into your bank or Twitter or Facebook, your web browser talks to those servers over what's known as TLS, which is an encryption layer that protects the confidentiality of that traffic.\n\"The intelligence agencies - not only NSA and GCHQ, but Canada and Australia and New Zealand- had spent 10 years and untold billions of dollars trying to break these fundamental encryption technologies.\n\"They honed things, like their power with super computers, but they were also able to mount a programme of inserting back doors into cryptographic software, and - perhaps a bit more troubling - the NSA launched a covert campaign to influence the very standards that programmers rely on to create encryption.\n\"So standards bodies write up 'here's how encryption works, here's how you implement it in your software', and the NSA was actually working against that effort.\n\"Ever since [the Snowden revelations were published in] 2013, there's been quite a movement to further encrypt the internet.\n\"I think there's been an awakening on the part of private companies that it is important to their users to keep [their data] confidential and secret.\n\"Apple saw these revelations about the overreach of intelligence services and law enforcement services, and created a phone that was harder to crack because they wanted to increase the security of their users. I do believe that.\n\"The Apple case is very hard. I see the arguments on both sides. I see the fact that the FBI wants access to this information, and I also see Apple's need to protect its customers' privacy.\n\"I hope that we come to a conclusion that is more open and transparent. What I would say is I like that this fight is happening in public so that we can have debates like this.\"\nThe Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT.

{"human": "Through the long, hot summer of 1976 Hunt's attempt to claw back a huge points deficit to reigning champion Lauda was big news in Britain.\nThe season was so dramatic it inspired director Ron Howard to make the 2013 film Rush.\nHowever, almost the entire season - including the British Grand Prix - was not broadcast on television in the UK because one of the cars was sponsored by a condom manufacturer.\nBBC Sport tells the story of how a forward-thinking contraception company led to an F1 blackout, as the sport draped itself in cigarette advertising.\nForty years ago, moral standards and sensitivities were different in Britain, while levels of advertising on TV, particularly in sporting events, would often be a source of angst.\nJonathan Martin, who was a producer on BBC's Sportsnight in '76 and would go on to create the Grand Prix programme two years later, says that F1 \"already had a special place\" because \"broadcasters had to tolerate\" on-car advertising, while \"in many other sports it was invisible\".\nAfter all, on-shirt advertising was not allowed in televised league football matches in England until 1983.\nIn '76 not all F1 races were televised in the UK, with coverage generally focused on glamour events such as Britain, Monaco, Germany and Italy.\nBut these would all be blacked out when John Surtees signed a sponsorship deal with the London Rubber Company, which would see his team's main F1 car emblazoned with the Durex brand.\nThe tipping point came at the non-championship Race of Champions at Brands Hatch in March, which the BBC was due to televise with Murray Walker commentating.\nIn his autobiography, Walker recalled: \"As far as the BBC was concerned a visible Durex logo was totally unacceptable for family viewing.\n\"I arrived at Brands Hatch to be greeted by producer Ricky Tilling with the words: 'Hi Murray, we'll know by 11am whether we're going to be on air or not.'\n\"'What are you talking about, Ricky?'\n\"'Durex. We're not going to transmit the race unless Surtees agree to take it off their cars.'\"\nThey did not, so the BBC packed up their cameras and left.\nSurtees, the only man to win the world championship in F1 (1964) and on 500cc motorbikes (1956, '58, '59, '60), had set up his own team in 1970 but they struggled at the top level.\nFinance, or the lack of it, was always an issue so it was almost a lifeline when the team was approached by the London Rubber Company with a sponsorship proposal \"offering a decent sum of money\".\nSurtees recalls: \"I said to them we would have to sit down and do it in a very wholesome and presentable way.\n\"I thought it would cause a stir but the fact remains that there was nothing sleazy about it and we weren't breaking any rules.\n\"It revitalised the team and gave it a second chance.\"\nAccording to Martin, the Surtees sponsorship \"caused a flurry at management level\" at the BBC and ITV, who also broadcast occasional F1 races at the time.\n\"Grand prix racing already had a special place and then when Durex appeared on the side of a car, there were certain apoplectic people around,\" he said.\nF1 in 1976 was all about Hunt and Lauda, the flamboyant British playboy and the methodical but brilliant Austrian. Although the two men got on well, conflict and argument was never far away.\nLauda had a 26-point lead when the cars went to Brands Hatch for the British Grand Prix in July but Hunt had won the previous race in France and had his points for finishing first in Spain reinstated after he had initially been disqualified.\nA record crowd descended on the Kent circuit on a scorching day to roar Hunt on, but it appeared that his race was over when his McLaren was damaged in a first-lap crash that caused the race to be stopped.\nStewards looked to set stop Hunt from taking part in the restart because he had not completed a full lap of the track when the original race was red-flagged.\nHowever, they soon changed their minds when the restless, sun-burned crowd began to slow-handclap, chant \"we want Hunt\" and throw missiles onto the circuit.\nCheers erupted when Hunt appeared on the grid and they were even louder when he won from Lauda to cut the Austrian's lead to 23 points.\nThe only TV coverage of the race in Britain was a short film shown on ITV's World of Sport a week after the event.\nTwo weeks on from Hunt's home win, Lauda almost died when his Ferrari exploded into flames in a crash at the notorious Nurburgring in the German Grand Prix. He suffered horrific burns, damage to his lungs and was given the last rites.\nThe Austrian survived and incredibly was back racing six weeks later at the Italian Grand Prix, by which time his championship lead was only two points over Hunt.\nThe press and the public were rapt. But, the short Brands Hatch film aside, British TV continued with its unofficial boycott of F1.\nLauda extended his championship lead to five points when Hunt spun off in Italy and the game appeared up when Ferrari's protest against Hunt's Brands Hatch win was upheld and the Briton was disqualified. The gap was now 17 points with three races to go.\nBut Hunt won in Canada and the United States, collecting 18 points while Lauda only managed two. It set up a showdown at the final race in Japan with the Austrian's lead down to three points.\nAt the BBC, it was time for a rethink.\n\"The Hunt-Lauda battle captured the public imagination,\" recalls Martin, who went on to become the BBC's head of sport.\n\"Especially when it went down to the last race in Japan, the management climbed down very rapidly off their social engineering stance.\n\"I was in the forefront of saying: 'Come on, we've got to go and do this' but I was helped in that by the fact that ITV were starting to think in the same way.\"\nITV had shown highlights of the penultimate race in the US and both broadcasters scheduled highlights of the Japanese GP.\nTorrential rain in Fuji delayed the start and when it did eventually get under way, Lauda decided to retire after two laps as he considered the conditions too dangerous. Hunt splashed around the soaked circuit to finish third and take the title by a single point.\nAnd, finally, British viewers were able to enjoy the drama.\nSurtees, now 82 and still a keen follower of F1, says he was disappointed that the Durex sponsorship proved so unpalatable.\n\"It was purely a question of the BBC making their decision. From the point of view of the sport, I was very unhappy,\" he said.\n\"It was very important for the sport to be able to give a good platform for people to support it. It didn't make me happy that the BBC took that position.\n\"I thought it was ill-advised considering so many government agencies were out there pushing these products.\"\nMartin, who says the interest generated by the Hunt-Lauda battle was the reason he suggested to BBC management that they should cover every F1 race from 1978, can see both sides of the argument.\n\"With hindsight, it was a fairly provocative thing to do.

Some have described the situation as South East Asia's Srebrenica, referring to the July 1995 massacre of more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims who were meant to be under UN protection - a dark stain on Europe's human rights record.\nTun Khin, from the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK, says Rohingyas are suffering \"mass atrocities\" perpetrated by security forces in the northern part of Rakhine state.\nA counter-insurgency campaign was launched after nine border policemen near Maungdaw were killed in a militant attack in early October, but the Rohingya say they are being targeted indiscriminately.\nThe BBC cannot visit the locked-down area to verify the claims and the Myanmar government has vociferously denied alleged abuses.\nBut UN officials have told the BBC that the Rohingya are being collectively punished for militant attacks, with the ultimate goal being ethnic cleansing.\nThe Rohingya are one of Myanmar's many ethnic minorities and say they are descendants of Arab traders and other groups who have been in the region for generations.\nBut Myanmar's government denies them citizenship and sees them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh - a common attitude among many Burmese.\nThe predominantly Buddhist country has a long history of communal mistrust, which was allowed to simmer, and was at times exploited, under decades of military rule.\nAbout one million Muslim Rohingya are estimated to live in western Rakhine state, where they are a sizable minority. An outbreak of communal violence there in 2012 saw more than 100,000 people displaced, and tens of thousands of Rohingya remain in decrepit camps where travel is restricted.\nHundreds of thousands of undocumented Rohingya already live in Bangladesh, having fled there over many decades.\nSince a dramatic Rohingya exodus from Myanmar in 2015, the political party of Nobel Peace Prize winner and democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi has taken power in a historic election, the first to be openly contested in 25 years.\nBut little has changed for the Rohingya and Ms Suu Kyi's failure to condemn the current violence is an outrage, say some observers.\n\"I'm not saying there are no difficulties,'' she told Singapore's Channel NewsAsia in December. \"But it helps if people recognise the difficulty and are more focused on resolving these difficulties rather than exaggerating them so that everything seems worse than it really is.''\nHer failure to defend the Rohingya is extremely disappointing, said Tun Khin, who for years had supported her democracy activism.\nThe question of whether she has much leverage over the military - which still wields great power and controls the most powerful ministries - is a separate one, he said.\n\"The point is that Aung San Suu Kyi is covering up this crime perpetrated by the military.\"\nBut others say international media fail to understand the complex situation in Rakhine state, where Rohingya Muslims live alongside the mostly Buddhist Rakhine people, who are the state's dominant ethnic group.\nKhin Mar Mar Kyi, a Myanmar researcher at Oxford University, told the South China Morning Post that the Rakhine were the \"most marginalised minority\" in Myanmar but were ignored by Western media, which she said displayed a \"one-sided humanitarian passion\".\nOther researchers like Ronan Lee of Australia's Deakin University disagree with this argument, noting that while the Rakhine also face deprivation, \"the solution when faced with massive rights violations is not to announce that someone else is worse off\".\nIn her recent media comments, Ms Suu Kyi said Rakhine Buddhists \"are worried about the fact that they are shrinking as a Rakhine population percentage-wise\" and said she wanted to improve relations between the two communities.\nA special Myanmar government committee appointed to investigate the ongoing violence in Rakhine state said in an interim report in early January that it had so far  found no evidence to support claims of genocide against the Rohingya, nor to back up widespread rape allegations.\nThe report made no mention of claims that security forces had been killing civilians. Observers had, in any case, not had high hopes of a credible or independent investigation from the committee, which is headed by former general and current Vice-President Myint Swe.\nRead more - \"The Lady\": A profile of Aung San Suu Kyi\nSouth East Asian countries generally don't criticise each other about their internal affairs. It's a key principle of the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean).\nBut the current situation has seen some strident criticism from Myanmar's Muslim-majority neighbours, along with protests.  Indonesian police even say they have foiled an IS-linked bomb plot targeting the Myanmar embassy.\nOn 4 December, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak questioned Aung San Suu Kyi's Nobel Prize, given her inaction.\n\"The world cannot sit by and watch genocide taking place. The world cannot just say 'look, it is not our problem'. It is our problem,\" he told thousands at a rally in Kuala Lumpur in support of the Rohingya.\nHis comments followed a call from Malaysia's youth and sports minister, Khairy Jamaluddin, for Asean to review Myanmar's membership over the \"unacceptable\" violence.\nSome question the timing of the comments, given the unpopular Mr Razak is gearing up for re-election.\n\"What we want is both talk and action to really help the Rohingya, not just ministers posturing to gain domestic political points,\" said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch.\nIn Bangladesh, which borders Rakhine state, Amnesty International says hundreds of fleeing Rohingya have been detained and forcibly returned to an uncertain fate since October - a practice it says should end. Bangladesh does not recognise the Rohingya as refugees.\nRead more: Bangladesh presses Myanmar on Rohingya\nLeading regional newspapers have condemned Asean's inaction, with Thailand's The Nation describing it as an \"accessory to murder and mayhem\".\nA meeting of Asean foreign ministers to discuss the crisis was held on 19 December in Myanmar's capital, Yangon, but was dismissed as \"largely an act of political theatre\" by the Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights grouping.\nIndonesia's ambassador to London, Rizal Sukma, told the BBC in December that a comprehensive approach was needed.\nHe said an investigation with regional participation should be launched and that his country stood ready to participate if any such commission was to be formed.\nA UN spokeswoman in 2009 described the Rohingya as \"probably the most friendless people in the world\".\nThe UN human rights office recently said for a second time this year that abuses suffered by them could amount to crimes against humanity. It also said that it regretted that the government had failed to act on a number of recommendations it had provided, including lifting restrictions of movement on the Rohingya.\nIt has called for an investigation into the recent allegations of rights abuses, as well as for humanitarian access to be given.\nThe UN's refugee agency says Myanmar's neighbours should keep their borders open if desperate Rohingya once again take to rickety boats to seek refuge in their countries, as happened in early 2015.\nSpokeswoman Vivian Tan said now would be a good time to set up a regional task force that had been proposed to co-ordinate a response to any such movements.\nRead more: Kofi Annan downplays Myanmar genocide claims\nSeparately, former UN-Secretary General Kofi Annan is heading another advisory commission currently looking into the general situation in Rakhine state after being asked in August by Ms Suu Kyi.\nBut some have questioned how useful this commission will be, given the exhaustive number of reports that already exist.

{"human": "The sceptics insist that growth has been largely jobless and deepened inequality in an already hierarchical society.\nThe optimistic refute this gloomy thesis and believe that the rising tide has lifted all boats.\nAs an example, they point to the emergence of a small but growing class of Dalit (formerly known as untouchables, the lowest in India's wretched caste hierarchy) millionaires.\nSo much so that Dalit activists like Chandra Bhan Prasad like to call it  a \"golden period\" for Dalits where \"material markers are replacing social markers\".\nStudies have also shown that the wage gap between Dalits and other castes have narrowed and their standing has improved. There is even a Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\nBut new research by Lakshmi Iyer, Tarun Khanna and Ashustosh Varshney paints a less rosy picture.\nDelving into the relationship between caste and entrepreneurship, the researchers have found that scheduled castes and tribes, the most disadvantaged groups in Hinduism's hierarchy, owned very little businesses despite a decade of sprightly economic growth and a long history of affirmative action.\nMining information thrown up by the 2005 economic census covering more than 42 million enterprises, they found schedule castes owned only 9.8% of all enterprises in India in 2005, well below their 16.4% share of the total population.\nThe scheduled tribes owned only 3.7% of non-farm enterprises despite being 7.7% of the population.\nHowever, ownership of business among OBC's - an acronym for Other Backward Castes or the \"middle castes\" who \"neither suffering the extreme social and economic discrimination of the Scheduled Castes, nor enjoying the social privileges of the upper castes\" - has grown.\nOBCs comprise 41% of India's people. Their members owned 43.5% of all enterprises in 2005, and accounted for 40% of non-farm employment.\nThis is a remarkable achievement considering that affirmative action for this group was widely introduced only in the 1990s.\nThe pattern of dismally low ownership of businesses among the most disadvantaged groups, the researchers found, is not specific to any one region or state in India.\nEven in states like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra that were among the first to have social movements to end caste discrimination, ownership of enterprises is low.\nStates with high population of the disadvantaged groups also show that they are under-represented in ownership of businesses.\nThe researchers say there could be a host of reasons - caste discrimination itself (members of other castes refuse to work with the lowest castes), lack of knowledge, illiteracy, and problems with securing finance.\n\"All these factors,\" they say, \"can prevent scheduled castes from entering industries that have significant economies of scale.\"\nGrowth possibilities are limited by differences in the size of worker networks -  scheduled caste owners find it easier to work with scheduled caste workers.\nI asked Dr Varshney, who teaches at the US's Brown University, whether the findings really came as a surprise, given that deeper social changes in societies like India take a lot of time.\nHe said he wasn't.\n\"I should, however, add that the story of the rise of the Dalit millionaires is not small either. Though numerically insignificant, it is politically, economically and socially very significant,\" he told me.\nOver time, he believes, the rise of Dalits \"may well become comparable\" to the rise of Nadars - a southern caste - in Tamil Nadu.\nUntil about 150 years ago Nadars - mostly \"toddy tappers\" - were condemned to a near untouchable status. Today, they are a leading business community in the state and are found in all classes.\nI asked Dr Varshney whether increased representation in politics had anything to do with higher ownership of business for different caste groups? I cited the example of the increasingly influential OBC-led politics in the country.\n\"Whether that happens remains unclear. The correlation undoubtedly exists, but the causes are still to be sorted out,\" he said.\nI also wondered why decades of affirmative action and more than two decades of economic liberalisation hadn't still unleashed entrepreneurial energies among the most disadvantaged.\n\"Such transformations can take a long time,\" he said. \"The rise of the Nadars, for example, took nearly eight to 10 decades, depending on how one defines the rise.\"", "prompt": "The sceptics insist that growth has been largely jobless and deepened inequality in an already hierarchical society.\nThe optimistic refute this gloomy thesis and believe"}

It is nice that you are linked with other jobs and so-called bigger clubs because that really means people realise the job you're doing here.\n\"That's the most important thing for me. I'm looking forward to this season, playing in Europe and doing well for St Johnstone.\"\nAs it turned out, Pedro Caixinha took over from Mark Warburton at Ibrox and Derek McInnes has chosen to remain at Pittodrie, despite having discussions about the Sunderland vacancy, leaving Wright in charge at McDiarmid Park.\nIn his four years at St Johnstone, and on a modest budget, he has guided them to the Scottish Cup, in 2014, and secured top-six finishes every season in the Premiership.\nAsked if he was surprised that his record had not led to approaches from other clubs, Wright told BBC Scotland: \"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't, but it's not something that keeps me awake at night.\n\"It's not something that, if I see someone else getting a job, puts me in a bad mood. It's just the way it is and all I can do is keep doing my job here.\n\"I'm quite happy for the chairman to come and extend my contract at St Johnstone if he wants, but by the look of his comments he'd rather sell me and get a few quid in.\n\"I just have a simple way of looking at things - do the job to the best of your ability, do it well and whatever will happen will happen.\"\nWright has been preparing his squad at Inverclyde Sports Centre in Largs for another crack at the Europa League, their reward for finishing fourth last term.\nHaving lost Danny Swanson to newly promoted Hibernian and now defender Tam Scobbie to Scottish Championship club Dundee United, Wright is looking to strengthen his squad.\nHe's in the process of clinching a deal to replace Swanson in time for the European signing deadline but the Scobbie departure has been a bit of a shock and it comes at a time when fellow defender Brian Easton is being treated for a groin problem.\n\"There is a risk Brian may miss Europe and that certainly leaves us short in terms of a left-back,\" said the Northern Irishman.\n\"I wanted Thomas {Scobbie} re-signed. I know he was more than happy to stay, but something's happened that it's fallen through so I've got to deal with that.\n\"It's part of management, you don't always get what you want and now we've got to move on and do the best for the club. I'm now putting all my efforts in to get a left-back to be cover for losing Thomas.\"\nWright drew praise for his handling of the infamous New Douglas Park brawl between Swanson and team-mate Richard Foster as they left the pitch at half-time in the match with Hamilton.\nBut the manager says that incident on 1 April was one of the toughest tests of his managerial career.\n\"I didn't see it and still haven't seen it because there's no footage of it, which is a miracle these days,\" he said.\n\"Immediately after the game, when I'm hearing what's allegedly happened, there was one thought in my head: that the two of them can go, they're out, they're sacked.\n\"But then it was time for calm heads and leadership from the club and myself. The lads very quickly helped the situation by admitting they were wrong, they were remorseful.\n\"So come the Saturday night they definitely weren't going to be sacked, but the chairman and I felt that for the image of the club we'd deal with this as severely and as quickly as we could (with a fine and reprimand).\n\"We were honest with the players, in terms of how we felt they had let not only themselves down, but the club and Scottish football as a whole.\n\"The timing of it could have derailed our season. We actually lost the game 1-0, losing a goal in the 91st minute after doing brilliantly with nine men and that was gut-wrenching for the players.\"\nWright feels that by beating Hearts with a weakened squad and then Inverness in Saints' next two games, it showed the benefit of  \"having good people and a good squad\".\nOn Monday, St Johnstone will find out who they will face in the first qualifying round of the Europa League.", "prompt": "The Saints boss had been linked with Rangers and Aberdeen in recent months.\nAnd the Perth club's chairman, Steve Brown, has spoken of his surprise that"}

Of these, 16 have been named by more than one complainant.\nBy Mark EastonHome editor\nThe scale of the investigation is quite a surprise.\nWe had a huge police investigation in the 1990s and we had a public inquiry led by a former judge, as well as other inquiries.\nAnd here we are all these years later, we look at this again and discover that it is far more widespread - over four decades, going right back to the early 1960s.\nPreviously, we thought it started during a period from the mid-1970s and the investigation now covers, not just three or four children's homes, but 18 children's homes.\nWe are talking about systemic, serious sexual and physical abuse that, it would appear, has been conducted by a large number of people.\nThere are 84 names - 75 men but nine women as well.\nIf the allegations are true, it's an appalling scandal and a scandal that, as some victims have said, was left unresolved for far too long.\nIt is believed that 10 of the 16 may be deceased.\nHome Secretary Theresa May ordered this inquiry following a Newsnight report in November, that as well as leading to a Tory peer being falsely accused of paedophilia, alleged that child abuse in north Wales in the 1970s and 1980s was far more widespread than had previously been investigated.\nNorth Wales Chief Constable Mark Polin said: \"Offenders quite rightly should have to look over their shoulders for the rest of their lives.\"\nKeith Bristow, director general of the National Crime Agency (NCA), has agreed to continue investigations at the request of Mark Polin, the North Wales chief constable.\n\"I took the decision to ask the director general of the National Crime Agency to investigate these allegations last November conscious that some victims of historic abuse may not have the necessary level of confidence in North Wales Police to report these matters directly to us,\" Mr Polin said.\n\"Operation Pallial has now secured accounts from almost all victims who are willing to support an investigation and it makes absolute sense for the officers and staff involved to date to be the core of phase two and to move matters forward as quickly as professionally as possible.\"\nAt a news conference in Colwyn Bay, Mr Polin told victims: \"It's never too late to report abuse.\"\nHe also sent a message to offenders, saying: \"If you believe the passage of time will reduce the resolve of Operation Pallial or any police force to identify people who are still alive and to bring them to justice, you are sorely mistaken.\"\nDet Supt Ian Mulcahey of Merseyside Police is leading the day-to-day investigation.\nHe said: \"We're prioritising our work focus on those individuals who pose the greatest risk to the public.\n\"I want to reassure the community that we are taking their allegations seriously and my officers are dedicated top ensuring that people who are responsible for these offences are held to account regardless of the passage of time.\"\nMr Bristow said the rest of the investigation would be conducted as quickly as professionally possible.\nHe said he believed it was \"very positive\" that so many people had come forward and that he hoped victims would receive more support than perhaps they had done in the past.\nA Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyer has been appointed to assist Operation Pallial.\nThe CPS lawyer has advised \"the priority should be given to the most serious allegations and the prioritisation process has been agreed with them\".\nThe investigation involves police officers and staff, primarily from forces in north-west England, supported by members of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP Centre).\nBy December it had heard from 105 victims of alleged abuse.\nAt the time, Det Supt Mulcahey said the investigation would \"follow the evidence without fear or favour\".\nA separate review by Mrs Justice Macur is investigating the terms of the Waterhouse abuse inquiry, which began in 1996.\nIt examined the abuse of victims in former north Wales care homes such as Bryn Estyn in Wrexham dating back to the 1970s.\nThe new inquiry followed a victim's claims that Sir Ronald Waterhouse only uncovered a fraction of the abuse.\nThose claims surfaced in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.\nLast week, one man was arrested in Ipswich, Suffolk, as part of Operation Pallial and questioned on suspicion of serious sexual offences against a number of people.

That's where we need to see some improvement if we can.\n\"We'll help David as much as we can.\"\nThe club, who were renamed London Broncos last year, have played at the Twickenham Stoop since 2006 following their affiliation with rugby union side Harlequins.\nTheir average league attendances have dropped in the last four seasons and the Broncos face a dilemma over where their long-term future lies.\nIn the years since their formation in Fulham in 1980, London's side have staged their home games at a plethora of venues across the city, including Craven Cottage, Crystal Palace Sports Centre, The Valley, Griffin Park and the Twickenham Stoop, as well as staging one-off games further afield.\nThe Broncos are looking to move ground ahead of next season, having decided against renewing their ground-share with rugby union side Harlequins.\nWood says it is up to the owners to decide where to base the club.\n\"The Broncos had have a concern over where they should be located in the capital,\" Wood said.\n\"We need to make sense of that and within the club they need to work out where their location is best served.\n\"There are pockets of activity in east London, some in the north and some out in Feltham where they train.\n\"The club is privately-owned and ultimately they are responsible for the destiny and direction of the club.\n\"The League will seek to assist and support and, where possible, provide counsel and advice.\n\"But at the end of the day we have to stop short of being the people that make the decisions as we are just a governing body.\"\nWhile the Broncos have fostered dual-registration ties with London Skolars and Hemel Stags, Wood says it is also the RFL's responsibility to aid and encourage new clubs further down the leagues.\nAlong with the Stags, Oxford and University of Gloucestershire All Golds are additions to the third tier Championship One this season and all three played their first competitive games at the weekend.\n\"Fundamentally as a governing body, we have got an obligation to invigilate the rules and adjudicate between the clubs on an impartial basis,\" Wood said.\n2009: 3,436 (13 games)\n2010: 3,374 (13 games)\n2011: 3,131 (13 games)\n2012: 2,703 (11 games)\n\"That is our first and foremost requirement.\n\"Rugby league has always, because of its dependency on certain geographical areas, stepped out of that straitjacket.\n\"We have said what more can we do to support the clubs that don't have the benefit of 100 years' worth of flourishing community game and or close neighbours who they can trade players with.\n\"We have tried over the last decade to work with clubs - as we have in London and Wales and as we will do so with Hemel, Oxford and Gloucester - to understand that they have slightly different challenges.\n\"It also presents fantastic opportunities. When you have a professional club in a new area they are frankly the only employment opportunity for certain players.\n\"We try and work with those clubs without over-stepping our mark of impartiality.\"", "prompt": "The capital has had a representative in Super League since its inception in 1996 but London's side has never won the league title or the Challenge Cup"}

He was a hero to Rubens Barrichello, who grew up metres from the race track and forged his passion watching Senna there, before graduating to F1 a couple of years before his death, befriending him, and then taking up his mantle. Felipe Massa, another local boy, followed suit.\nThe fans know the glory days have long gone, that a Brazilian victory is as unlikely as a day without a traffic jam in one of the world's most crowded cities.\nBut still they come, packing the grandstands and singing and chanting from early in the day.\nWhat draws them there? A deep-seated passion for the sport, for one. The almost-certainty of a great sporting spectacle, for another.\nInterlagos has a knack for producing exciting races. Drama is synonymous with the track, not least because of its position at the business end of the season.\nIt is a claustrophobic place. The circuit winds around a natural amphitheatre, high on a hill, the sprawl of Sao Paulo both a backdrop and crushing in from all sides. The heavy humidity, and almost-permanent threat of rain, add to the atmosphere.\nIt feels locked in, and not just because of the cramped old paddock, a fraction of the size of anything Bernie Ecclestone finds acceptable these days.\nThe track is a splash of vibrant green in an ocean of concrete grey and smog brown; the city butting up against the perimeter fence, endless tower blocks filling the skyline.\nTwenty years ago, a favela sprawled up the hill all the way to the perimeter wall. There has been an attempt to spruce things up a bit, the old corrugated-roof shacks replaced by flats closest to the circuit, houses of naked breeze blocks a bit further down the road. But down at heel, to say the least, it remains.\nThere is an unmistakable edge. The road up to Interlagos is not a place for a stranger to linger.\nInside, the track feels like a haven. One of the shortest laps on the calendar somehow packs in a long straight - superb for overtaking - and a challenging sequence of long corners, the best the uphill double right-hander of Ferra Dura/Laranha and the fast downhill left of Mergulho. It's a great race track, with emphasis on the \"race\".\nThey are corners with a history - the new track is about half of the old one. Part of a previous era, it was a magnificent five miles of twists and turns, uphill and down, which started with two incredible, banked, high-speed left-handers, taken absolutely flat out by some, still visible outside the modern Turns One, Two and Three.\nIt all adds to the character of the place.

{"human": "Union leaders are hoping the formation of a first so-called Dairy Producer Organisation (DPO) could help put the industry on a stronger footing.\nIt would involve small family farms across Wales linking up to talk with milk processors as one legal entity.\nThe hope is that streamlining the way farmers deal with creameries could attract more of them to Wales.\nBut a report has warned that persuading farmers to join up could be a challenge, and there would be no guarantee that processors would agree to strike a deal with them.\nThe main purpose of a DPO is to negotiate terms and conditions of supply, including price, with one or more milk processors. As such, they are exempted from some aspects of competition law.\nThere is currently one DPO in operation in England, and one in Scotland - but they are commonplace throughout Europe, especially in Germany.\nA working group, involving figures from both farming unions, is investigating what role DPOs could play in securing the industry's future in Wales.\nAled Jones, chairman of NFU Cymru's dairy board told BBC Wales that \"farmers coming together\" could lead to \"a far more professional means of operating\".\n\"At the moment we deal on an individual basis with the processor but I think long term we are far stronger if we speak with one voice and have that cooperation and attitude of mind.\"\nRecent years have seen farmers protesting outside creameries over milk prices but Mr Jones said the focus should now be on \"building better relationships\".\n\"Nearly half of Welsh milk is carted out of Wales to be processed and that puts us in a weak position.  We saw that last year when there was an oversupply of milk and farmers in West Wales were in danger of not having a buyer for their milk.\"\n\"Looking forward we must try and attract new investment or increased processing in Wales.  And obviously, to do that you need to work in a professional manner.\"\nMr Jones, who farms in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, explained that the idea offers security and added value to both producers and processors, but that setting one up could take years.\nA report commissioned on behalf of the working group warned that persuading farmers to take part could be far from easy.\nPlan needed for rural economy - Labour AM\nFarming collaborations have a relatively poor track record in Britain and many producers would be wary of getting their fingers burnt, said report authors Promar International.\nHowever the consultants concluded that farmers in Wales should seriously consider DPOs or live with \"the insanity of accepting the status quo\".\nUK government ministers have indicated that they see a role for them - so farming leaders claim the concept - a product of EU law - will be unaffected by Brexit.\nThe position of many dairy producers in Wales is fragile after a tumultuous few years, during which the price of milk fell sharply.\nAt one point in 2016 it was below 20p per litre at farm gate prices - the average price paid to all producers for milk sold to dairies.\nFigures show the number of dairy farms here has nearly halved during the last 15 years, with an average of three farmers a month leaving the industry.\nFarming leaders say that though the price of milk has recovered somewhat in recent months, many producers are still struggling and are now shouldering heavy debts.\nA new three part series, starting on BBC One Wales on Monday, takes an in-depth look at the industry's problems.\nGareth Wyn Jones - Milk Man is on at 20:30 GMT, BBC One Wales on Monday 6 February 2017 and later on BBC iPlayer.", "prompt": "Union leaders are hoping the formation of a first so-called Dairy Producer Organisation (DPO) could help put the industry on a stronger footing.\nIt would"}

It boycotted the first sitting of parliament since the elections and threatened to form a parallel government.\nFrelimo has dominated politics in Mozambique since the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. But despite Mr Nyusi's win, the party saw a sharp decline in votes compared to the previous election in 2009 when predecessor Armando Guebuza scored a massive 75%.

Born in 1959, he hails from the gas-rich far northern province of Cabo Delgado near Tanzania.\nHis parents were veterans of the country's civil war and he was educated at a Frelimo party school set up for the children of fighters.

{"human": "From 2010 until mid-2014, world oil prices had been fairly stable, at around $110 a barrel. But since June prices have more than halved. Brent crude oil has now dipped below $50 a barrel for the first time since May 2009 and US crude is down to below $48 a barrel.\nThe reasons for this change are twofold - weak demand in many countries due to insipid economic growth, coupled with surging US production.\nAdded to this is the fact that the oil cartel Opec is determined not to cut production as a way to prop up prices.\nSo who are some of the winners and losers?\nRussia is one of the world's largest oil producers, and its dramatic interest rate hike to 17% in support of its troubled rouble underscores how heavily its economy depends on energy revenues, with oil and gas accounting for 70% of export incomes.\nRussia loses about $2bn in revenues for every dollar fall in the oil price, and the World Bank has warned that Russia's economy would shrink by at least 0.7% in 2015 if oil prices do not recover.\nDespite this, Russia has confirmed it will not cut production to shore up oil prices.\n\"If we cut, the importer countries will increase their production and this will mean a loss of our niche market,\" said Energy Minister Alexander Novak.\nFalling oil prices, coupled with western sanctions over Russia's support for separatists in eastern Ukraine have hit the country hard.\nThe government has cut its growth forecast for 2015, predicting that the economy will sink into recession.\nFormer finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, said the currency's fall was not just a reaction to lower oil prices and western sanctions, \"but also [a show of] distrust to the economic policies of the government\".\nGiven the pressures facing Moscow now, some economists expect further measures to shore up the currency.\n\"We think capital controls as a policy measure cannot be off the table now,\" said Luis Costa, a senior analyst at Citi.\nWhile President Putin is not using the word \"crisis\", Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has been more forthright on Russia's economic problems.\n\"Frankly, we, strictly speaking, have not fully recovered from the crisis of 2008,\" he said in a recent interview.\nBecause of the twin impact of falling oil prices and sanctions, he said the government had had to cut spending. \"We had to abandon a number of programmes and make certain sacrifices.\"\nRussia's interest rate rise may also bring its own problems, as high rates can choke economic growth by making it harder for businesses to borrow and spend.\nVenezuela is one of the world's largest oil exporters, but thanks to economic mismanagement it was already finding it difficult to pay its way even before the oil price started falling.\nInflation is running at about 60% and the economy is teetering on the brink of recession. The need for spending cuts is clear, but the government faces difficult choices.\nThe country already has some of the world's cheapest petrol prices - fuel subsidies cost Caracas about $12.5bn a year - but President Maduro has ruled out subsidy cuts and higher petrol prices.\n\"I've considered as head of state, that the moment has not arrived,\" he said. \"There's no rush, we're not going to throw more gasoline on the fire that already exists with speculation and induced inflation.\"\nThe government's caution is understandable. A petrol price rise in 1989 saw widespread riots that left hundreds dead.\nSaudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and Opec's most influential member, could support global oil prices by cutting back its own production, but there is little sign it wants to do this.\nThere could be two reasons - to try to instil some discipline among fellow Opec oil producers, and perhaps to put the US's burgeoning shale oil and gas industry under pressure.\nAlthough Saudi Arabia needs oil prices to be around $85 in the longer term, it has deep pockets with a reserve fund of some $700bn - so can withstand lower prices for some time.\n\"In terms of production and pricing of oil by Middle East producers, they are beginning to recognise the challenge of US production,\" says Robin Mills, Manaar Energy's head of consulting.\nIf a period of lower prices were to force some higher cost producers to shut down, then Riyadh might hope to pick up market share in the longer run.\nHowever, there is also recent history behind Riyadh's unwillingness to cut production. In the 1980s the country did cut production significantly in a bid to boost prices, but it had little effect and it also badly affected the Saudi economy.\nAlongside Saudi Arabia, Gulf producers such as the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have also amassed considerable foreign currency reserves, which means that they could run deficits for several years if necessary.\nOther Opec members such as Iran, Iraq and Nigeria, with greater domestic budgetary demands because of their large population sizes in relation to their oil revenues, have less room for manoeuvre.\nThey have combined foreign currency reserves of less than $200bn, and are already under pressure from increased US competition.\nNigeria, which is Africa's biggest oil producer, has seen growth in the rest of its economy but despite this it remains heavily oil-dependent. Energy sales account for up to 80% of all government revenue and more than 90% of the country's exports.\nThe war in Syria and Iraq has also seen Isis, or Islamic State, capturing oil wells. It is estimated it is making about $3m a day through black market sales - and undercutting market prices by selling at a significant discount - around $30-60 a barrel.\n\"The growth of oil production in North America, particularly in the US, has been staggering,\" says Columbia University's Jason Bordoff.\nSpeaking to BBC World Service's World Business Report, he said that US oil production levels were at their highest in almost 30 years.\nIt has been this growth in US energy production, where gas and oil is extracted from shale formations using hydraulic fracturing or fracking, that has been one of the main drivers of lower oil prices.\n\"Shale has essentially severed the linkage between geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East, and oil price and equities,\" says Seth Kleinman, head of energy strategy at Citi.\nEven though many US shale oil producers have far higher costs than conventional rivals, many need to carry on pumping to generate at least some revenue stream to pay off debts and other costs.\nWith Europe's flagging economies characterised by low inflation and weak growth, any benefits of lower prices would be welcomed by beleaguered governments.\nA 10% fall in oil prices should lead to a 0.1% increase in economic output, say some. In general consumers benefit through lower energy prices, but eventually low oil prices do erode the conditions that brought them about.\nChina, which is set to become the largest net importer of oil, should gain from falling prices. However, lower oil prices won't fully offset the far wider effects of a slowing economy.\nJapan imports nearly all of the oil it uses. But lower prices are a mixed blessing because high energy prices had helped to push inflation higher, which has been a key part of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's growth strategy to combat deflation.\nIndia imports 75% of its oil, and analysts say falling oil prices will ease its current account deficit. At the same time, the cost of India's fuel subsidies could fall by $2.5bn this year - but only if oil prices stay low.", "prompt": "From 2010 until mid-2014, world oil prices had been fairly stable, at around $110 a barrel.

{"human": "\"Look how we made a nick in the tree, collected the oil and then blocked it up so the wound would heal.\"\nWalking through the exuberant Amazon forest, Dedel pointed out the trees, including andiroba, Brazil nut, and cupuacu,  from which his community extracts oil.\nIt is easy to think Dedel was brought up in the forest, relying on knowledge passed down the generations. But this is far from the truth.\nDedel and his family, like many others living in this region, migrated to the Amazon region from the drought-ridden north-east of Brazil.\nThey came in search of land and eventually got a plot under an ambitious government programme to settle thousands of families along the Transamazon highway.\nIn the 1990s, they practised slash-and-burn agriculture to plant subsistence crops and pasture for cattle.\nBut some families in Dedel's settlement, called Rio Trairao, began to realise that this kind of farming was exhausting the soil.\nThe settlers began to consider a new kind of economic activity.\nTheir idea was not to stop their old farming practices overnight but to combine them with the sustainable extraction of oil from the andiroba tree.\nWith the support of an energetic Roman Catholic nun, Sister Angela Sauzen, the Seeds of the Forest project was created.  Since then, it has expanded to include more forest products and involve more communities.\nThe transition has not been easy. The settlers had to turn to older communities in the region to learn how to extract the oil. They had to go through the complex bureaucratic process of setting up a company, made all the more difficult because the agrarian reform institute, Incra, has still not recognised their right to the land.\nThey also had to conform to high technical standards to sell their oils to demanding beauty products manufacturers. Some of the families gave up, realising that it would take time to get a good financial return, but many remain enthusiastic.\nBut the settlers' main problem has been the implacable opposition of big landowners and logging companies who lay claim to their land.\nThis is even though the government decided in 1971 that a 100km band of land on either side of the Transamazon Highway should be occupied exclusively by small farmers under the agrarian reform programme.\nThe loggers, who are the main economic force in the region, admit off  the record that they are all to some extent operating illegally.\nThis is partly, they say, because it is difficult to meet all the bureaucratic requirements covering their activities under Brazilian legislation.\nAdair Abel Vargas, one of the biggest loggers in the region, said: \"Incra didn't do what it promised. It gave the plots to the families but didn't build the roads they needed to reach them. It was us, the loggers, who built all the roads.\"\nUsing this power of patronage, the loggers have acquired great political power in the region. Today they believe that their dominance is being challenged by the families in Rio Trairao, who are proposing a new sustainable way of living off the forest.\nThe loggers' hostility towards Seeds of the Forest has grown in recent months because the settlers want the authorities to allow them to use another large area of forest adjacent to their settlement. This is an area regularly ransacked by the loggers.\nDedel said that loggers had warned them that they would be risking their lives if they pressed ahead.\n\"We haven't been intimidated,\" he said. \"What really bothers us is the number of trees they're felling. When they began, it was one tree here, another 200m away.\n\"But now they're taking out all kinds of other less valuable timber  - macaranduba, angelim vermelho, amarelao and so on. And when they go into the forest, they also damage a lot of the trees we need.\"\nDomingos Nicolodi is a cattle rancher  who wants to take over 6,000 hectares of land exactly in the area the settlers are already using to collect forest products.\nAlthough this would be more than the maximum area of public land that a single landowner can purchase under the Brazilian constitution, Mr Nicolodi was quite open about his ambitions.\nHe would put the land to good use, he said, by rearing cattle on it and contributing to the wealth the agri-business sector brings to Brazil.\nWhen asked what he thought about the Seeds of the Forest project, he replied: \"This is all the fault of that crazy nun. I don't know why she has to get involved in these land questions. She should stay in the church, praying.\"\nSister Angela shrugged off this criticism, saying that what was important was that Incra legalised the settlers' situation.\n\"We have repeatedly asked for urgent action\", she said. \"And while nothing happens, the forest is being emptied into the loggers' lorries.\"\nTwo irreconcilable visions of the future of the Amazon rainforest are competing here.\nSome, such as the community of Trairao, are attempting to live off  the forest, while preserving and enhancing its biodiversity for the future.\nBy contrast, there are those who believe that while some areas should be protected, the Amazon is a valuable resource that should be exploited, even if that means felling the trees.\nThe Brazilian government has passed tough environmental regulations about how land in the Amazon should be cleared but these are not being properly implemented, largely because there are far too few law enforcers on the ground.\nFor the moment, Sister Angela and Dedel feel very much on their own.", "prompt": "\"Look how we made a nick in the tree, collected the oil and then blocked it up so the wound would heal.\"\nWalking through the exuber"}

Or more likely Greece simply looks like a wonderful place to take the kids compared with resorts closer to territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State.\nBut why aren't the Greeks manning the barricades in protest against already-announced, painful VAT increases and pension cuts, and in anticipation of swingeing reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatisations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition?\nWell it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain â‚¬86bn of new credit from the eurozone and (well maybe) the IMF, in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country.\nSurely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year.\nPresumably the explanation is that Greece's near-death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA (\"there is no alternative\").\nWhat is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular, in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal (tax and spending) austerity.\nWorse, his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too: the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend.\nNot that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment, but if retailers and wholesalers can't get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad, Christmas will be cancelled (70% of shops' orders are placed in September and October, bankers tell me).\nThere is the vice, in both senses of the word. Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze, which will undoubtedly further impoverish Greek people.\nSo for all the relief throughout the eurozone that Syriza has finally been battered into submission, the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead.\nMany would say that good economics and politics requires creditors to ease the burden of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half.\nSo if this new bailout deal is to be that extraordinary thing, a path to genuine recovery, Brussels and - especially - Berlin will need to avoid triumphalism and manifest debt forgiveness in the face of Athens' capitulation.", "prompt": "No demos on the streets of Athens - even though the Syriza government is poised to agree and implement yet more austerity and liberalisation measures, mandated"}

From the bank's point of view, they are cheap to look after.\nYet they get no price reductions.\nOn the face of it, digital customers are getting a raw deal.\nLloyds - the UK's biggest retail banking group - boasts that is has 10 million customers who access its services via the internet.\nIn effect, those 10 million are paying for the other 12 million customers who still want a premium and personalised service; namely the ability to go in to a centrally-heated, business-rate paying, well-decorated and well-staffed High Street branch, to speak to a human being.\n\"If I'm just using online, and never go into a branch, or never ring a call-centre, I would expect to get a better price, because otherwise I am subsidising those people who go into a branch,\" says Kevin Mountford, head of banking at MoneySupermarket.\nNo bank will say how much its branch network really costs them. But Lloyds has no fewer than 1,300 such branches in England and Wales alone. And Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) spent £400m last year on refurbishments.\nEither way, transactions on the internet cost banks a tiny fraction of those in-branch, or compared to the cost of processing a cheque.\n\"As a customer, if I am seeing that my behaviour brings down the operational cost, what's in it for me?\" says Mr Mountford.\n\"I would expect something back. But unfortunately it doesn't happen.\"\nNone of the big High Street banks offer their customers separate internet banking directly. However HSBC and The Co-operative Bank do so under separate brands.\nOne of them is Smile, the first full internet bank to be set up, in 1999, and owned by the Co-op.\nSmile customers borrowing £500 for a month benefit significantly. The cost is just £7.34, as opposed to £17.40 with the Co-op.\nThe other is First Direct, which - as a telephone and internet bank only - has much lower running costs than its parent brand, HSBC.\nYet First Direct charges £83.05 to fund a £500 overdraft for a month, only marginally cheaper than HSBC's £87.52.\nMark Mullen, the former chief executive of First Direct - and now boss of Atom Bank - is not impressed.\n\"I think it is astonishing that you can have banks with very different cost bases, very different sizes of banks, and very different histories of technology, yet somehow miraculously they price just about the same.\"\nOthers might wonder why, if Smile charges £7.34 for an overdraft, and HSBC charges £87.52 for exactly the same thing, more customers aren't switching; or why the self-evident benefits of internet banking aren't available more widely.\nThe banks concerned argue that customers are unlikely to be charged the amounts listed above, as they would be advised to take out a personal loan instead of the more expensive overdraft option.\nIn any case, the mainstream banks believe consumers should not be getting lower prices for banking online.\nThey are acutely aware that differential pricing would make life more expensive for older and vulnerable customers, who rely on a branch network, and often still use cheques.\nJames Daley, the managing director of Fairer Finance, and a former campaigner with Which? believes that banks have a social responsibility to provide an equal service for everybody.\n\"You start telling pensioners that they're going to have to pay twice as much for their banking services because they aren't comfortable with the internet - I don't think that would be the right solution.\n\"I wouldn't want to advocate a world where people who bank predominantly online end up with significantly better deals than those customers who have to use branches.\"\nSo are online customers going to have to continue tolerating paying over the odds for banking?\nThe answer to that could depend on the launch of Atom, the UK's first truly internet-only bank, sometime before Easter.\nBuilt from scratch, with just 150 staff at its Durham headquarters, Atom will only offer access via the internet or an app. No branches, no call centres.\nAs a result of its low cost base, it is promising cheaper prices.\n\"We would expect to be more competitive when it comes to some - not all - of our charges, and some of our costs,\" says Mark Mullen.\nFor example, customers will not be forced to pay both an interest charge and a fee for an overdraft.\nAnd there will be no distinction between an authorised and an unauthorised overdraft. \"That's just nonsense\", says Mr Mullen.\nBut even if Atom does offer its users a significantly better deal, the rest of the industry may not feel obliged to follow suit. In this market, competition does not work as it should.\nSo without a significant shift in banks' attitudes, digital customers may continue to argue they're not getting a good deal.\nBut they may just have to lump it.\nMonday: Do other countries offer consumers better banking than the UK?", "prompt": "On everything from music to microwaves, and taxis to train tickets.\nConsumers save money by doing their transactions on a computer or mobile phone.\n"}

{"human": "A series of groups spoke out after Europe's top court ruled a Romanian man whose employer read his messages had not had his rights violated.\nHe broke company policy by using a work account to talk to his family.\nIn response, bodies representing directors and workers, as well as privacy and human resources groups, all issued similar warnings to bosses.\nThe European Trades Union Congress, which represents workers across the continent, said the judges' decision should not act as a \"green lightâ€¦ to start snooping\" on staff.\nThe case in the European Court of Human Rights did not introduce any new rules, but acted as a stress test for those that already allowed similar surveillance by employers in some circumstances.\nInstitute of Directors director general Simon Walker said: \"Employees should not be subject to Stasi-style surveillance at work.\n\"We would strongly urge businesses not to read an employee's personal messages, apart from in the most exceptional circumstances.\"\nBritish Trades Union Congress general secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"Big Brother bosses do not get the best out of employees.\n\"Staff who are being snooped on are less productive and less healthy\".\nAnd the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said: \"Employees that feel under excessive surveillance are also more likely to suffer from stress, so there needs to be a clear case for monitoring.\"\nThey were joined by the privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, which said: \"None of us should ever assume that what we do online during work hours or when using devices owned by our employer, such as computers, tablets or mobile phones, is private - but, equally, no employee should be in fear of being monitored by their boss.\"\nThe judges' ruling, handed down on Tuesday, said Romania had not failed to uphold the right to a private life of its citizen Bogdan Barbulescu.\nMr Barbulescu's employer had sacked him after finding he had been using a Yahoo Messenger account to speak to both his fiancee and his brother, despite having been asked to set up the account for work purposes only, the seven judges said.\nThe company had also banned private use of the internet at work.\nWhen confronted, Mr Barbulescu had denied violating the policy, the judges found.\nAnd the company had therefore been justified in reading both the work and private correspondence on the account - some of it highly sensitive.\nMr Barbulescu said his rights had been violated and, having been unsuccessful in arguing as much in the domestic courts, asked the judges to rule that Romania had failed in its duty to him.\nThe court's decision does not introduce new measures.\nReading the messages was already legal in Romania, as it is in other countries, including the UK.\nRather, it agreed with the Romanian authorities that the circumstances in which Mr Barbulescu's messages had been read did not represent a breach of his right to a private life.\nThe judges, in effect, declined to send a signal to courts across Europe that they considered surveillance under those circumstances unacceptable.\nIf the judges had found the other way, the Romanian government would have been obliged to abide by their decision.\nOthers, however, would not, because European Court of Human Rights decisions affect only the country named in the case.\nThe effect on domestic courts is different.\nEach country adopts its own approach to the court's decisions.\nIn the UK, for example, judges are obliged to take them into account, not to follow them without question, as has sometimes been claimed.\nMoreover, the court's decision did not actually go further than existing UK laws, which already allowed some reading of employees' communications under certain circumstances.\nOne of the seven judges, who disagreed with his colleagues, did say that the blanket ban on private internet use at work imposed by Mr Barbulescu's former employer was unacceptable and there should be stricter regulation of when and how bosses should be allowed to carry out such surveillance.\nThe case before the court considered the specific circumstances in which Mr Barbulescu found himself - rather than workplace surveillance as a whole - and agreed that they were not a breach of his rights.\nSo, avoiding those would be a good start.\nIn the UK, the amount of access employers have to employees' communications is defined by a series of laws and regulations that balance when it is lawful against when it is proportionate and necessary.\nEssex University professor of EU and human rights law Steve Peers told the BBC: \"Employees might be violating employer policies if they install software to block tracking.\n\"It is best for people to stick to company policy on use of work equipment and use their own smartphones if they need to do something personal.\n\"Definitely the wisest course for people whose company policies allow their work emails to be read - or who believe their employer would do it anyway - is to use their own phone or tablet, and use mobile data if they can, instead of employer wi-fi.\"\nApps that use end-to-end encryption, such as Signal, WhatsApp and others, provide an extra level of security.\nBroadly, \"the legal principles should be similar across Europe, particularly regarding personal data, as this is derived from EU legislation\", said Kathryn Dooks, an employment partner at the law firm Kemp Little.\nBut some domestic laws and regulations would differ, she told the BBC.\nThe banking regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, requires banking companies to \"take reasonable steps to record relevant telephone conversations, and keep a copy of relevant electronic communications\" on company equipment.\nFCA-regulated businesses must also take steps to stop staff sending work messages on their own equipment.\nAccording to a 2014 Financial Times article, some banks became so concerned employees, aware they were being watched, would move to non-work channels to engage in illicit behaviour that they started comparing performance against average internal communications channel use.", "prompt": "A series of groups spoke out after Europe's top court ruled a Romanian man whose employer read his messages had not had his rights violated.\nHe broke company"}

{"human": "The so-called Christmas Blitz on the evening of 22 December reduced shops and buildings in St Ann's Square to ruins. The area around Deansgate near the cathedral was badly damaged, with a large bomb crater marking the road.\nWar Office photographer William Lockeyear took a series of images as buildings burned and masonry came tumbling down. The sky glowed orange as huge clouds of smoke billowed and thickened the air with dust. The pungent whiff of burning wood and the smell of powdered brick and plaster lingered.\nTwo waves of bombs pounded the city from 20:00 GMT on 22 December, only ending at 06:00 the next day.\nAmong the buildings hit in the heart of the city were Manchester's Free Trade Hall, the Royal Exchange, Smithfield Market, Cheethams Hospital, the Gaiety Theatre and St Ann's Church.\nIn total, 684 people died and a further 2,300 were wounded with districts to the north and east of the city badly affected, notably Cheetham Hill and Strangeways. At least 8,000 homes were made uninhabitable.\nDuring the war as a whole, 1,400 civilians died in Manchester, so the raid represents almost half those killed. One in 10 of was under the age of 13.\nSeven-year-old Doreen Herring saw a Luftwaffe plane flying overhead as her family, from Pendleton, made their way to an air raid shelter.\nThey looked up and saw the pilot pause and then the plane sped ahead without dropping a bomb. \"I am convinced it was because he could see us,\" she said.\nHer father, George Pinder, refused to go to the air raid shelter and said: \"If a bomb wants to get me, it will get me.\"\nThey were terrified of seeing if their house had been damaged when leaving the shelter. \"Next door to us had been bombed to bits.\n\"All you wanted to do afterwards was to have a cup of tea.\"\nShe remembers there were a lot of children's funerals and the disgusting smell of rotten food after the bombing ended. \"You could breathe again,\" she added, when the raids were over.\nPeople coped by cooking using broken furniture in their gardens that they would burn on fires to create heat. If water mains were damaged, they would drink water from bowsers.\nFather George Street, 34, who had spent all night helping people amid the bombing, died when the church of St Augustine in York Street took a direct hit. A collage of mangled chalices and church items is now on the wall of the new church in All Saints Place, off Oxford Road.\nThe current incumbent, Father Dave Lannon, said Father Street had offered his usual chair to another priest. Had he stayed there \"he would have survived\".\nGeoffrey Whittle was 12 when he was evacuated twice from the home he shared in Gorton with his grandmother to the leafy suburbs of Bramhall.\nHowever, he hated it there - his hosts imposed a \"cruel\" regime of being forced to eat the previous day's leftovers - and he was back in Gorton when the raid took place.\nHe remembers closing all the curtains when the air raid sirens went off and being scared of any light showing through.\n\"We were all settled in this brick shelter about 500 yards away from the house in Greave Street, Gorton. Then this man would play the piano accordion and sing war songs.\n\"Everyone would be singing along and I don't remember getting any sleep in the shelter.\"\nSusan Jones, 16 at the time, was shopping in Ancoats as the bombs started dropping. She watched pieces of shrapnel hitting the buildings and sparking and bouncing off.\nShe took refuge in the shelter near the Avro Manchester factory, where she was working as a riveter and driller on Lancaster bombers. The sight of several cockroaches scuttling across the shelter led her to volunteer for fire warden duties on the factory roof.\n\"The shrapnel started coming down and one bit hit a wall of one of the big mills,\" she said. \"I could see sparks and I was hugging the wall to try and stay safe. I wasn't frightened because of my age at the time, I thought I was indestructible and found it dead exciting.\"\nOne of her relatives was hit in the face by an incendiary device during the raids, but survived.\n\"It was a dreadful thing,\" she said of the Christmas Blitz. \"I looked up at the sky and it seemed like everything was on fire. There was an acrid smell of burning and from the guns. The sky was all orange and yellow it looked like the fireworks I'd seen at Belle Vue when I was younger.\"\nHistorian Ian Kikuchi, from the Imperial War Museum North in Trafford, said there had been few fatalities in Manchester until the Christmas Blitz.\n\"The heaviest bombing previously had been in the East End of London,\" he said. \"The Luftwaffe launched bombings across Britain as they were trying to disrupt food supply and were targeting ports and centres of distribution.\"\nMr Kikuchi said the Germans bombed Coventry in November 1940 because of its strategic position in heavy industry, but the focus soon shifted to other cities across Britain.\nHe said the raids had been anticipated by British intelligence. \"What was surprising was the intensity of the raids,\" he said.\n\"The Luftwaffe saw Manchester as an adjunct to the port of Liverpool, which was a major industrial centre.\"", "prompt": "The so-called Christmas Blitz on the evening of 22 December reduced shops and buildings in St Ann's Square to ruins.

{"human": "Wallace's name might not have the same cachet as Keegan, Dalglish or Rush but his place in Liverpool history is unassailable - he scored the club's first European goal.\nHis landmark moment came in Iceland when he opened the scoring in a 5-0 win over K.R. Knattspyrnufélag Reykjavíkur in 1964.\n\"The great Roger Hunt went to the by-line, squared it back to me and from all of those six yards out I powered it in,\" said Wallace who was only playing because Ian St John was ill.\nIt's more than 55 years since he left Llanelli for Liverpool, but Wallace has not lost a trace of his Welsh accent.\nSo how did the son of a Scotland international claim his place in footballing history? And why does he have a south Wales lilt when he speaks?\nIt's a story that takes in one of Wales' most famous rugby academies and Huddersfield Town. Wallace, now 71, recalls it all with fondness.\nWallace was five years old when his father, former Scotland centre forward Dougie Wallace, was appointed player-manager at Llanelli AFC.\nAs a teenager he went to Gwendraeth School, where Barry John - nicknamed The King - and before him Carwyn James took their first steps to rugby stardom.\n\"The school was rugby orientated. Barry was two years younger than me and even then I used to love to watch him play,\" Wallace told BBC Wales.\n\"But my childhood dream was to become a footballer. I wanted to be just like my dad.\"\nWallace played in the Llanelli junior league between the ages of 11 to 14, before playing for Glan Morfa where his talent was discovered.\n\"It was late October 1959. I remember it well,\" he says of the day Bill Shankly's scout spotted him.\n\"There's somebody I want you to have a look at\" was the message sent back to Shankly, then manager of Huddersfield Town.\nWallace had trials with the Terriers and when Shankly went to Liverpool, he took Wallace with him.\n\"At the end of my third trial at Huddersfield, Bill Shankly signed on the Monday to become manager of Liverpool Football Club,\" Wallace continued.\nAfter Liverpool won the Division One title in 1963-64, they were offered automatic qualification for the European Cup for the first time.\n\"Liverpool in the 60s was vibrant - The Beatles, 50,000 in the stadium, 28,000 in the Kop swaying to their songs. I remember it like yesterday,\" Wallace said.\n\"I wasn't always on the pitch but I was always part of the party. We had a fabulous squad. Ronnie Yates, Ian Callaghan, Roger Hunt, Ian St John. An odd person might get injured so you might get a game now and then.\"\nAnd it was sickness that gave Wallace his break when fellow Scot St John had suffered appendicitis a few weeks before Liverpool's first European tie in Iceland.\nWallace recalls the journey was as memorable as the game, \"Back then you couldn't get a direct flight to Iceland. We flew to Glasgow with a six-hour wait,\n\"[Shankly] didn't want us lounging around so off we went on a bus to a holiday camp. I'll always remember the fella stopping us at the gate.\n\"The boss went over and said, 'I'm Bill Shankly, I'm going to Reykjavik in Iceland and this is Liverpool Football Club'. The guy replied, 'Well you're on the wrong road, Mr Shankly, You should have taken a right back that way'.\"\nWallace and the team got through the gate, onto the flight for Iceland, and a little piece of history followed.\n\"The goal came after three minutes,\" recalls Wallace, \"It hadn't dawned on me it was the first-ever goal in Europe until about six months later when someone mentioned it would be a good quiz question.\"\nHe also played a leading part in another landmark game, scoring twice in a 3-2 win over Arsenal - a game televised by the BBC on the first Match of the Day.\nHe spent another two seasons at the club before moving on to Crewe Alexandra in 1967 for £9,000.\n\"I would have loved to have played a lot more games than what I did, but I was so proud to be part of that squad. Shankly started what Liverpool Football Club is today,\" he said.\nWallace draws comparisons between Shankly and current Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who has steered the club to Europa League final in his first season at Anfield.\n\"They're very, very similar,\" Wallace said, \"Klopp's so enthusiastic, he's got a great character about him. He's got the players motivated.\n\"The Dortmund game [where Liverpool fought back to win 5-4 on aggregate in the Europa League quarter-final] - that was second only to the Inter Milan [European Cup] semi-final [first leg] in 1965 [which Liverpool won 3-1].\n\"To see Klopp on the line, chanting and running, when the players see that, they play for him like we played for Shankly.\"", "prompt": "Wallace's name might not have the same cachet as Keegan, Dalglish or Rush but his place in Liverpool history is unassailable"}

Made a really important save from Tom Rogic soon after Celtic had clawed it back to 2-2. That was a huge moment and then he saved from Scott Brown in the shootout.\nJames Tavernier (defender) 7\nEverybody questioned him defensively beforehand, but he answered them all. Only once did he revert to fouling Patrick Roberts and he didn't give Gary Mackay-Steven a sniff when faced with him. Also kept attacking throughout, although it was a tired penalty kick he missed in the shootout.\nRob Kiernan (defender) 7\nShowed great composure at times during the game, bringing the ball down and playing it out of dangerous areas with passing triangles. Didn't play with any fear before his injury and was solid defensively.\nDanny Wilson (defender) 8\nHas improved in recent months and that showed in this game. He took charge at the back and showed maturity and composure throughout. Handled the difficult challenge of facing Griffiths well.\nLee Wallace (defender) 8\nHis energy levels were remarkable. In the first half, he and Barrie McKay were excellent as a pairing. Wallace had to defend well against Roberts, but kept to his strengths and was always bombing forward. Even in extra time he was running beyond McKay to make things happen, and was strong defensively. A consummate pro and played a captain's role.\nAndy Halliday (midfielder) 7\nScott Brown dominated the midfield in last season's Old Firm game, but Halliday stood up to him, got tackles in and got the fans going. He also showed a good range of passing. Set the tone for Rangers early on with his energy and assertiveness and took responsibility by scoring Rangers' opening penalty in the shootout.\nDominic Ball (midfielder) 7\nPlayed in the holding role and was booked in the second half so will miss the final. Stefan Johansen created a couple of openings early on, but Ball was solid and kept the play moving. Looked comfortable when he switched to centre-back after Kiernan was injured.\nJason Holt (midfielder) 7\nNice and bright in possession throughout, and was always looking to link up with the forwards in the final third. Also didn't neglect his defensive duties. His performance was like his season: consistent.\nDean Shiels (forward) 7\nWas asked to play in a position that is not his strongest, wide on the right. Tracked back and performed diligently, while contributing to Rangers' good possession in the first half.\nKenny Miller (forward) 7\nEarly on, his intelligent run beyond Charlie Mulgrew delivered a chance and Craig Gordon had to save well. That's typical Miller, he sniffs out a chance and is always on the move. Took his goal well, tucking it away as he has done all his career. Typically sharp and hard working.\nBarrie McKay (forward) 9\nEven prior to the goal, he was Rangers' best player. Early on, he and Wallace combined well down the left, as Rangers took the game to Celtic. Has quick feet and glides past players. Gave Mikael Lustig a hard game. Always looked after the ball and scored an outstanding goal.\nNicky Law (midfielder) 6\nIt's always difficult to come into a game like this as a substitute. He was also asked to play in an unfamiliar position wide on the right. Will be disappointed to have let Kieran Tierney in to cross for Celtic's equaliser but he atoned in the shootout, with a cool penalty.\nGedion Zelalam (midfielder) 6\nFilled in when Ball had to move into defence and tried to keep play moving. Showed composure in the shootout to score a pressure penalty.\nNicky Clark (forward) 6\nWorked hard and showed good energy when he replaced Miller. Stepped up during the shootout but saw his effort saved\nCraig Gordon (goalkeeper) 7\nDid everything he was asked to do during the game. He didn't have any chance with either of the Rangers goals, but gave Celtic hope in the shootout when he saved Clark's penalty.\nMikael Lustig (defender) 6\nThe Sweden international had a hard time against Barrie McKay, particularly in the first half. He also didn't link up well with Patrick Roberts in front of him, and McKay and Wallace were able to get in a few times.\nDedryck Boyata (defender) 5\nOnly played for 23 minutes before leaving the field with an injury. Still made a couple of mistakes in that time, being caught in possession and having to commit a foul to halt a Rangers attack.\nCharlie Mulgrew (defender) 6\nHe was steady throughout the game at centre-back, and showed his experience. Didn't do anything wrong, and was fine in possession. Stepped up to take a penalty in the shootout.\nKieran Tierney (defender) 8\nClearly Celtic's best player. At times he was up against two Rangers players, but still able to handle both of them very well. Worked up and down the pitch, showed good defensive instincts and still had the legs and the wherewithal to create the equaliser late on in extra time with a great cross for Tom Rogic.\nScott Brown (midfielder) 7\nAnother steady performer for Celtic. At the start of the second half, when Celtic needed to up the tempo, he pushed further forward and helped to haul his side back into the game. He did what was asked of him.\nNir Bitton (midfielder) 6\nIn extra time he was signalling that he had a hamstring injury and needed to come off. But he stayed on the pitch, kept playing on and then stepped up to take a spot-kick. For all his ability, though, he was still too quiet at times.\nGary Mackay-Steven (forward) 5\nCouldn't really get into the game. Celtic did not use him that much, but in that case he then has to go looking for the ball, and demand to receive it. The game passed him by.\nStefan Johansen (midfielder) 5\nDidn't deliver enough on the day. With his talent, he should have been more influential, but that's been the story of this season for the Norwegian international.\nPatrick Roberts (forward) 6\nShould have equalised in the first half when faced with an open goal and had another scoring opportunity in the second half on his right foot, so missed big chances. Great delivery for the corner kick that Erik Sviatchenko scored from, but he tired late on.\nLeigh Griffiths (forward) 6\nNot one of his better games, looked jaded and could have worked the Rangers centre-backs more. He didn't get the right supply, but still managed to hit the post and then the bar late on with a magnificent free-kick which could have won the game.\nErik Sviatchenko (defender) 7\nScored a powerful header and had two more on target. Did OK defensively and shored Celtic up; his partnership alongside Mulgrew looked stronger.\nCallum McGregor (midfielder) 6\nWas busy when he came on, without influencing the outcome of the game. Also missed one of the spot kicks.\nTom Rogic (midfielder) 7\nScored a great goal and made things happen when he came on.

{"human": "Consider the unreliable plumbing, dated wallpaper, and room service meals that can arrive an hour late and stone cold.\nBut a German tech start-up called Triprebel hopes to overcome one of the most vexing obstacles to a pleasant stay; paying too much for your room.\nBecause nothing spoils a trip more than leaving your expensive single room to eat breakfast beside another guest who paid far less for their penthouse suite.\nThat concern is the driving focus for Triprebel's CEO, Carlos Borges, who describes the new website as the \"smartest way to book your hotel.\"\nHe says current travel search engines - think Expedia, Kayak or Orbitz - offer users a snapshot hotel rate at the precise moment they initiate a search. But the market for hotel rooms, he explains, \"is not like a snapshot, it's like a movie.\"\nIn short, room amenities and prices fluctuate, like plot twists.\nTriprebel's algorithm constantly checks the rates for each hotel room, from the moment it is booked, until a couple of days before a guest checks in.\n\"So if the rate goes down,\" Mr Borges says, \"we change it automatically for you and you get the full advantage of that better rate.\"\nThat 'full advantage' means a refund of the difference in price, with the firm taking a commission on the cheaper replacement booking.\nTriprebel's numbers show that a third of hotel rooms are available at a lower rate in the month after they are booked.\nThe tech start-up is one of several that have taken up residence in one of the warehouse buildings that line Hamburg's old port canals. The firm shares its building with Greenpeace and the WWF in this rapidly developing industrial neighbourhood.\nA stack of beer sits waiting in a corner for the end of the week. Mr Borges says the company's growth for the most recent quarter, which he pegs at 140%, is a reason to celebrate.\nBut before that, a half dozen staff must first test an additional 400,000 hotels that will soon be included in the website's algorithm. An employee's dog provides a welcome distraction, beneath a hanging picture of a Land Rover, with the slogan 'Never Stop Exploring.'\n\"We are travellers ourselves so we really feel good about helping our fellow travellers,\" enthuses Mr Borges, a Brazilian who originally moved to Germany to study for an MBA.\n\"When we get an email from someone praising the room he has, because he got upgraded, that's something that makes us feel very enthusiastic about what we're doing.\"\nStaffers hail from diverse professional backgrounds in Italy, Austria and the Netherlands. Currently about half the website's traffic comes from German users, and it may prove challenging to expand internationally into the already saturated online travel search marketplace.\n\"Competing with other start-ups is matter of how good your execution is and how well you're funded,\" Mr Borges says. \"So there we have a headstart, we've already been funded. We've already executed some of the technologies.\"\nBut some travel experts question not the technology, but the financial model behind the business.\nA website user is not charged a premium to guarantee the cheapest room price, but travel writer Alison Rice says the company's long-term profitability could be reliant on cooperation from the hotel industry.\n\"They like early bookings so they've got the money in the bank, they know they can stay open and pay their staff,\" says Ms Rice of hotel proprietors.\n\"What happens when, come nearer the date, they decide to drop the price to fill empty rooms and they have to pay the money back to Triprebel? I'm not sure how that will work with the hotels.\"\nTravel industry consultant, Ian Mackinnon thinks this could prove an obstacle: \"I think this will probably lead to a change whereby hotels will ask you for a deposit at the point of booking.\"\nSome independent hotels have already rebelled against the existing price comparison sites by guaranteeing that only guests that book rooms directly with them can access the lowest room prices.\nMr Borges - who says he founded Triprebel after struggling to organise a group holiday for 10 friends - says pushback from parts of the hotel sector will not upset his overall business strategy.\n\"We're building Triprebel as a shopping assistant,\" he explains as he wrestles a football from the mouth of the boisterous office dog.\n\"The end goal is that consumers can come to us, state the purchase intention and we go out there and buy the right product at the right time, considering not only hotels but the whole travel experience, from the flights to the car rental, to the hotel to the activities at the destination.\"\nAs he puts it, \"the boring part of doing the trip is up to us.\"", "prompt": "Consider the unreliable plumbing, dated wallpaper, and room service meals that can arrive an hour late and stone cold.\nBut a German tech start-up called Tri"}

{"human": "But in April - before the EU referendum - the then home secretary gave a speech warning of the implications of a vote to leave the EU. Here's how some of the key quotes compare:\nApril 2016: \"So, if we do vote to leave the European Union, we risk bringing the development of the single market to a halt, we risk a loss of investors and businesses to remaining EU member states driven by discriminatory EU policies, and we risk going backwards when it comes to international trade.\n\"But the big question is whether, in the event of Brexit, we would be able to negotiate a new free trade agreement with the EU and on what terms.\"\nJanuary 2017: \"I respect the position taken by European leaders who have been clear about their position, just as I am clear about mine. So an important part of the new strategic partnership we seek with the EU will be the pursuit of the greatest possible access to the single market, on a fully reciprocal basis, through a comprehensive free trade agreement.\"\nApril 2016: \"The reality is that we do not know on what terms we would win access to the single market. We do know that in a negotiation we would need to make concessions in order to access it, and those concessions could well be about accepting EU regulations, over which we would have no say, making financial contributions, just as we do now, accepting free movement rules, just as we do now, or quite possibly all three combined.\n\"It is not clear why other EU member states would give Britain a better deal than they themselves enjoy.\"\nJanuary 2017: \"If we were excluded from accessing the single market, we would be free to change the basis of Britain's economic model.\n\"But for the EU, it would mean new barriers to trade with one of the biggest economies in the world. It would jeopardise investments in Britain by EU companies worth more than half a trillion pounds... and I do not believe that the EU's leaders will seriously tell German exporters, French farmers, Spanish fishermen, the young unemployed of the eurozone, and millions of others, that they want to make them poorer, just to punish Britain and make a political point.\"\nApril 2016: \"It is tempting to look at developing countries' economies, with their high growth rates, and see them as an alternative to trade with Europe. But just look at the reality of our trading relationship with China - with its dumping policies, protective tariffs and industrial-scale industrial espionage. And look at the figures. We export more to Ireland than we do to China, almost twice as much to Belgium as we do to India, and nearly three times as much to Sweden as we do to Brazil. It is not realistic to think we could just replace European trade with these new markets.\"\n\"And while we could certainly negotiate our own trade agreements, there would be no guarantee that they would be on terms as good as those we enjoy now. There would also be a considerable opportunity cost given the need to replace the existing agreements - not least with the EU itself - that we would have torn up as a consequence of our departure.\"\nJanuary 2017: \"We want to get out into the wider world, to trade and do business all around the globe. Countries including China, Brazil, and the Gulf States have already expressed their interest in striking trade deals with us.\"\nApril 2016 (responding to a question from the BBC): \"What matters is that we have brought about changes in the free movement rules as a result of the negotiation.\"\nJanuary 2017: \"As home secretary for six years, I know that you cannot control immigration overall when there is free movement to Britain from Europe.\"\nApril 2016: \"With no agreement, we know that WTO rules would oblige the EU to charge 10% tariffs on UK car exports, in line with the tariffs they impose on Japan and the United States. They would be required to do the same for all other goods upon which they impose tariffs.  Not all of these tariffs are as high as 10%, but some are considerably higher.\"\nJanuary 2017: \"And while I am confident that this scenario need never arise - while I am sure a positive agreement can be reached - I am equally clear that no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain.\n\"Because we would still be able to trade with Europe.

The priority status it has enjoyed with government contracts is coming to an end, and it is facing increasingly stiff competition – at home, from a bullish SpaceX company, whose low-cost rockets are winning favour with Nasa and commercial satellite operators; and abroad, where Europe and Russia are both moving to new-generation rocket systems that aim to reduce their launch prices also.", "prompt": "The concept will be known as Vulcan, and it is expected to start operations in 2019.\nUnited Launch Alliance - the joint venture between Boeing and"}

The US said it was \"deeply disappointed\".\nBefore he was handcuffed and led away, Navalny urged his supporters to continue his anti-corruption struggle, tweeting: \"Don't sit around doing nothing.\"\nNavalny has previously said he would like to stand for president one day.\nHe had recently registered his candidacy for the next mayor of Moscow, but his campaign team said that after the verdict he was withdrawing from the race, and called on his supporters to boycott the vote.\nBy Oleg BoldyrevBBC News, Kirov\nMinutes after Judge Blinov started reading from the substantial sheaf of papers, it became evident the two defendants, Alexei Navalny and Pyotr Ofitserov, were going to be found guilty.\nSeasoned observers of this trial were just about able to pick up the judge's words. Others were bewildered by the hum-like reading.\nEntering the courtroom just before the verdict reading started, both defendants were far from gloomy. \"Why sad faces?\" quipped Navalny, walking past dozens of journalists and a row of cameras.\nNavalny has long acquired the skill of tweeting and blogging while interminable financial documents were read by prosecution, defence and, now, judge.\nPublishing his fiery comments on politics, corruption and the need to unite in opposition to Vladimir Putin's regime - that's one of the many things he won't be able to do from behind bars, waiting for the sentence to be appealed against.\n'Explosion of anger'\nThe BBC's Moscow correspondent Daniel Sandford says that when the sentence was handed down, there were tears from Navalny's supporters and an explosion of anger on the social networking sites that he has used so effectively.\nAnti-Putin activist and former cabinet minister Boris Nemtsov told reporters the trial was \"completely fabricated from start to finish, and even the judge could not say what the reason for the crime was\".\nOther countries have also voiced their concern at the verdict. The US ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, said: \"We are deeply disappointed in the conviction of Navalny and the apparent political motivations in this trial.\"\nA spokesperson for the EU's top foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, said the embezzlement charges were unsubstantiated, and that Navalny's jailing posed \"serious questions as to the state of the rule of law in Russia\".\nFrench foreign ministry spokesman Philippe Lalliot added his concern, but said: \"We note that not all judicial remedies have been exhausted and that the sentence could be reviewed on appeal.\"\nNavalny's supporters in Moscow have vowed to stage protests against the verdict later on Thursday.\n'Almost inevitable'\nNavalny arrived at the courtroom in Kirov to hear the verdict after a 12-hour overnight train journey from Moscow.\nOur correspondent said Navalny smiled in a resigned manner when the almost inevitable guilty verdict came.\nHis wife, Yulia Navalnaya, said her husband knew he would get a non-suspended sentence and was mentally prepared to go to prison.\nNavalny was found guilty of heading a group that embezzled timber worth 16m rubles ($500,000; Â£330,000) from the Kirovles state timber company while working as an adviser to Kirov's governor Nikita Belykh.\nThe prosecution had asked for a six-year jail sentence, but judge Sergei Blinov decided on five years, and said there were no extenuating circumstances that would warrant keeping Navalny out of prison.\nNavalny's co-accused, Pyotr Ofitserov, was also found guilty, and given a four-year jail sentence.\n\"Navalny... committed a grave crime,\" said Judge Blinov as he delivered the sentence.\nState television has only shown limited interest in the process despite Navalny's prominence, but online the trial has been followed extensively.\nMr Navalny came to public attention when he inspired mass protests against the Kremlin and President Vladimir Putin in December 2011.\nProfile: Alexei Navalny\nA thorn in Putin's side\nJudge Blinov said he found the testimony of the main prosecution witness, Vyacheslav Opalev, to be \"trustworthy and consistent''.\nNavalny insists that Mr Opalev spoke against him out of revenge, because Navalny had recommended he be fired and his company investigated for corruption.\nAfter the verdict, Navalny tweeted: \"So that's it. Don't get bored without me. Most importantly, don't sit around doing nothing. The toad won't get off the oil pipe by itself.\"\nIn his LiveJournal blog on Wednesday Navalny said: \"The current authorities are not a big, healthy fish, but rather a bloated fish or Latin American toad, which puffs itself up when it sees danger, with the help of television.\"\nIn an unusual step, the court allowed the whole trial to be broadcast live online.\nHe is now one of the key figures of the opposition - a thorn in the side of the political establishment, campaigning against the endemic corruption, our correspondent says.\nMr Navalny has also coined a phrase to describe the ruling party United Russia that has stuck in everyone's minds - \"the party of crooks and thieves\".", "prompt": "Navalny had denied the charges, saying the trial was politically motivated.\nThe 37-year-old had been a leading campaigner against President Putin's"}

It was one of the first international tournaments in world football and, consequently, was considered by some as the first World Cup.\nWest Auckland Town won the tournament, and repeated that feat two years later, beating Juventus 6-1.\n\"There was nothing about it in the English press at the time, but it was massive news in Italy and all over the newspapers,\" says the club's general manager Stuart Alderson.\n\"We got to keep the trophy and we had it on display until 1994, when it was stolen. We have a replica now, and people still come from all over the world to see it.\"\nWest Auckland begin their pursuit of FA Cup glory at Lancashire-based side Nelson, a team which also boasts a proud history, having been the first English side to beat Real Madrid in Spain.\nThey were a league side during the 1920s, rising to the old Second Division - now the Championship - in 1923, beating the likes of Leeds and Manchester United.\nIn preparation for their first campaign at that level, they opted for a pre-season tour of Spain, where they beat Real Oviedo 2-1 and Real Madrid 4-2.\n\"Everybody is well aware of the team's history in Nelson,\" manager Mark Fell said. \"The story of beating Real Madrid has been passed from generation to generation.\n\"This club has a rich history and it is our job to make this generation proud of their team.\"\nWhen the teams are read out for Staveley Miners Welfare's tie against Worksop Town on Friday night, there could be a very familiar name among them.\nJack Waddle, the 20-year-old son of former England winger Chris, recently signed for Worksop, the side his father played for 15 years ago.\n\"Jack is very much following in his father's footsteps,\" Worksop secretary Paul Stacey said. \"He missed our first two games through injury, however I believe he is in the squad for the FA Cup game.\"\nChris Waddle played in two FA Cup finals at Wembley - losing one with Spurs in 1987 and another with Sheffield Wednesday in 1993.\nWith a World Cup winner and the son of an England winger involved, there is already an international feel to the FA Cup, but that is heightened by the inclusion of FC Romania. It is not the country, of course, but a team named after it.\nFormed by Romanian Ion Vintila and his friends eight years ago, Hertfordshire-based FC Romania have progressed a great deal since playing their first competitive fixture against a team called Beating Chastards.\nThey shot up seven leagues in eight seasons, turned semi-professional this year and have even had a former international footballer on their books.\nClaudiu Raducanu, capped twice by Romania, previously played for Espanyol in Spain and Romanian side Steaua Bucharest, for whom he scored against Southampton in the 2004-05 Uefa Cup.\nHe left in the summer but Vintila has not ruled out the possibility of him returning. The prospect of an FA Cup appearance may prove a tempting proposition.\n\"The FA Cup is the oldest competition in football, and it was always our goal to play in it,\" says Vintila. \"We usually get around 80 to 100 people at games, but hopefully 500 will come down for this game.\"\nFC Romania, making their FA Cup debut, play Haverhill Rovers in the extra preliminary round this weekend.\nAs a child, James Phillips used to dream of guiding a non-league side to FA Cup glory as he played Championship Manager on his computer. On Saturday, the 22-year-old Romsey Town boss will not only get to live out his dream, but he'll also be making history as the youngest manager in the competition's history.\n\"I was one of those sad people after school who was sat there for hours playing Championship Manager,\" Phillips told BBC Sport. \"I always used to try to take a really small club up through the leagues. From a really young age that got my interest going. Now I'm doing it in real life.\"\nPerhaps winning the award for the most unusual name, and statistic, is Billingham Synthonia - the only team in England named after an agricultural fertiliser.\nThe Synners most famous player is Brian Clough. The former Derby County and Nottingham Forest manager made four appearances for them, scoring three goals in the 1952-53 season before he went on national service.\nOn Saturday, the team named after fertiliser host Durham City. It could make for an interesting tie if they progress and are drawn against West Allotment Celtic in the preliminary round...\nNever mind dreaming of a Wembley final appearance, the players at one club have their eye on another prize for doing well in the FA Cup - £15 kit bags.\nSporting Khalsa host Pegasus Juniors and, if they win to progress to the preliminary round, a bag sporting the club's emblem is all theirs.\n\"That's the joys of the FA Cup at grassroots level,\" Sporting Khalsa manager Ian Rowe told the FA.\n\"The pros are fortunate enough to get to the quarter finals, semi-final and final - we are just looking to win one game so I can splash the cash and buy the lads a £15 bag each.\"\nEllesmere Rangers have been involved in the FA Cup every year since 2008-09, but they got into this season's edition by the skin of their teeth.\nThe Shropshire-based team compete in the West Midlands League Premier Division - the 10th level of English football -  and qualified under the FA's points per game system, which rewards those clubs who miss out on automatic qualification with a place in the competition based on their form across the previous season.\nEllesmere qualified in the final slot, effectively making them entry number 736 - the last team in the hat.\n\"We finished 11th last season so we didn't expect to get in this year,\" says club secretary John Edge. \"It really is a big boost for the club because the prize money can help you through a whole season.\"\nOn 30 May, 2015, the FA Cup trophy will stand on a pedestal at a packed Wembley, but its journey begins in more humble surroundings.\nThe trophy will travel to Gloucestershire on Saturday, to the town of Fairford, whose team begin their FA Cup journey with a home tie against Knaphill.\n\"It is a huge day for the club,\" said committee member Chris Tanner. \"Everyone at Fairford is looking forward to the game and to have the FA Cup coming to town is quite special.\n\"The FA Cup generates tremendous interest for clubs both in the professional game and non-league and Saturday will be no different.\n\"Perhaps some won't have realised the FA Cup starts in August.\"\nThe Football Association has quite a job on its hands to make sure all extra preliminary round results are accurate, and that teams do not field ineligible players.\nIn previous years, the home club would report results by voicemail message, which would then have to be decoded by the FA and Press Association before the result could be confirmed and later published. These days the system is set up to be more efficient.\nThe FA sends out an automated text message to each club 15 minutes after kick-off, which explains how the result needs to be reported by text simply by replying to the message. The result and attendance is then published automatically on receipt by The FA of the incoming text message.\nIn order to avoid clubs fielding ineligible players, both teams are required to complete an official team sheet, which is then inspected by a match official, prior to a tie taking place.\nThe above are just a few of the unique tales to come from this year's FA Cup, but we want to hear your FA Cup story.\nDo you have an interesting tale to tell about your team's exploits and do you have any pictures that best sum up the magic of the cup?

We were trying to investigate whether there was evidence for the preservation of neural tissues from very early parts of the animal fossil record,\" he told BBC News.\n\"What we've been working with is fossils with very fine anatomical preservation from the Cambrian period. These have given us information about brains, the nerve cords and the neural tissue that goes into the eyes.\"\nNew to science, the fossil was recently discovered in South China and is part of the genus Alalcomenaeus.

The team then used 3D software to see structures not visible on the surface of the fossil.\n\"People like myself who are mad keen on creepy crawlies want to understand how very strange early arthropods relate to living ones,\" added Dr Edgecombe.\n\"By having access to the nervous system it allows us to study the evolutionary relationships of very ancient fossils using the same kind of information that we would use for living animals.\"\nCo-author, Xiaoya Ma, also from the Natural History Museum, said: \"It is very exciting to use new techniques to successfully reveal such a complete central nervous system from a 520-million-year old fossil, and in such detail.\"\nShe told the BBC's Science in Action programme that the high resolution of the reconstructed image allowed the team to see \"the concentrated neural structures in the head region\".

Yet even so, she was turned down for membership of the prestigious French Academie des Sciences in 1911, the very year she went on to win her second Nobel Prize.\nThe Nobel laureate Sir Tim Hunt was heavily criticised for his disparaging remarks about women in science last week, which for some raised the issue of where women stood in the scientific community.\nThe larger truth is that women have made big and important discoveries in science - think of Dorothy Hodgkin, the brilliant crystallographer who mapped the structure of penicillin and went on to be awarded a Nobel Prize in 1964.\nHodgkin was the first woman to win the prestigious Copley Medal, and she remains the only British woman to have won a Nobel in the sciences. Yet at the time, the newspapers carried headlines such as \"Oxford housewife wins Nobel\".\nBut many female scientists in the past were not given the credit they deserved for their achievements. As a result, their names have all but disappeared from public consciousness.\nHere are just a few.\nEsther Lederberg, a microbiologist, conducted groundbreaking research in the field of genetics.\nShe developed basic techniques that have gone a long way towards helping scientists understand how genes work.\nHer work helped her husband, Joshua, win a Nobel prize in 1958, but she was not cited in the award.\nThe British biophysicist Rosalind Franklin was a pioneering X-ray crystallographer.\nHer image of the DNA molecule was critical to deciphering its structure - one of the biggest and most important scientific breakthroughs of the 20th Century - but it was James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins who received the 1962 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their work.\nIda Tacke made huge advances in both chemistry and atomic physics.\nIt was she who managed to find two new elements, rhenium and masurium, that Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted would form part of the periodic table.\nShe gets credit in the science books for the discovery of rhenium.\nBut masurium is now known as technetium, the discovery of which is attributed to Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segre.\nTacke's evidence was ignored until Perrier and Segre artificially created the element in a laboratory.\nTacke is also credited with being the first person to open up the idea of nuclear fission.\nLise Meitner's work in nuclear physics led to the discovery of nuclear fission - where atomic nuclei split in two.\nThis laid the groundwork for the atomic bomb.\nAfter moving to Berlin in 1907, Meitner collaborated with chemist Otto Hahn over many decades.\nBut Hahn published their findings without including Meitner as a co-author.\nAnd he went on to win the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his contributions to splitting the atom.\nChien-Shiung Wu was one of the most important physicists of the 20th Century.\nShe participated in the development of the atom bomb, as part of the Manhattan Project. Yet few know her name today.\nIn the 1950s, two theoretical physicists, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang, asked Wu to help disprove what is known in physics as the law of parity.

It very rarely happens, but her words sounded like music to me.\"\nWilliams, the winner of a Golden Globe in 2012 for playing Marilyn Monroe in Simon Curtis's  My Week With Marilyn, adds that \"when you are dealing with the legacy of a real life person, it's a responsibility heaped on you.\n\"You want to be true to that person, and in this case, I wanted to be faithful to Irene. The fact that this story was very nearly never published makes it more precious.\"\nWilliams plays the role of Lucille, a young wife in the French provincial town of Bussy, who waits for news of her husband, fighting for France, under the disapproving eye of her mother-in-law, played by Kristin Scott Thomas.\nShe meets a young German officer and falls in love, even as the town is brutalised under occupation from its invaders.\nIn the novel, Lucille's love affair is just one of many stories Nemirovsky weaves of life under Nazi control. But Suite Francaise, written in tiny handwriting in a notebook as paper became more scarce, was never completed.\nNemirovsky was taken to Auschwitz, and her notebook was passed to her youngest daughter, Denise Epstein, who didn't open it until 2004, thinking it contained her mother's journals.\nUpon discovery and publication, Nemirovsky was posthumously awarded the prestigious French literary prize, the Prix Renaudot, and her other novels were also successfully republished.\nExpressing her sorrow that Epstein died in 2013, \"just before we made the film, and so I never got to meet her,\" Williams calls meeting the author's descendants \"the most special day of filming; they came to the set, and it was emotional for everyone\".\nAnd Scott Thomas added: \"It just really is all about the incredible story of Irene and her book, and I just hope the film has done it justice, because its publication was very important - it's a historical document for France.\n\"This tale of violent occupiers - this is recent history we are re-telling, from the time of our grandparents, and it has terrible poignancy for today as well, all over the world.\n\"I think what was interesting is that Irene had no Jewish characters in her book, or anything to say about their persecution.\n\"Some commentators have called her anti-Jewish as she hadn't embraced or exposed what was going on with her people at that period in France.\n\"However, in our film version, we have a moment where you do see what is happening to the Jewish people, and that was our own tribute to the fate of Irene.\"\nDirector Dibb, whose previous work includes The Duchess, starring Keira Knightley, describes adding those scenes as \"a necessary piece of artistic licence\".\n\"Irene wrote so generously about her occupiers. The book was written in 1940, in the early stages of the war, and she doesn't even refer to them as Nazis.\n\"She had no perspective on what happened to her people, and what happened to France. However, she was killed by her occupiers, and killed by those French collaborators too, who helped deport their Jewish populations.\"\nWilliams defends the choosing of just one storyline from the original novel, saying, \"the book itself is incomplete and so fragmented that it would be difficult to tell as a film unless one story is picked out.\n\"I'm glad they chose Lucille's love story - I think many people will identify with the story of love in hopeless circumstances.\n\"But what's also interesting for me is my character starts out as fragile and naïve, and becomes a revolutionary.

{"human": "This is the full statement to the inquests from his niece, Ms Natalie Tennant, on behalf of his brother, Peter Copoc:\nStephen Paul Copoc was born on 1 August 1968, and was aged 20 years when he died at Hillsborough.\nStephen was the baby of our family, and the apple of our Mum's eye. Our family consisted of Mum and Dad, I, Peter, my sister Angela and then our Stephen. I was 10 years old when Stephen was born. Angela was just seven years old.\nOur Dad took us to the hospital, so that we could meet our new baby brother. Mum and Dad said that Angela and I could name him, and we did. Financially, we had little, but our parents, Agnes and Harold, made sure that there was lots of love in our house.\nStephen was such a joy to all of us. Mum and Dad only received good reports from Stephen's school regarding his conduct and application to his lessons.\nProfiles of all those who died\nStephen's personality was such that people warmed to him instantly as he had an easy way with him. He was popular with teachers and made friends, having the ability to also keep friends. The friends that he made when he was small were still his close friends when he died on that awful day.\nWhen we moved from Garston to our new house in Speke, Stephen had no problems adapting to the new environment, getting to know our new neighbours and making friends in an effortless and  uncomplicated way.\nI started work at 17. There was a shop in Garston called Smiths that sold everything. It's gone now. I bought Stephen a train set when I got paid. He was about nine at the time and wanted one.\nAs Angela and I were so much older than him, we kind of spoilt him, as he was such a lovable kid. I remember us both setting up the train set together and the joy Stephen got playing with it.\nHe was so careful about his toys. When he finished playing with the train set, he would put it away neatly. He minded his toys.\nHe used to follow Angela everywhere, even if she was going out to meet friends he would follow her and she would complain to Mum and Dad about having to bring 11 him.\nHowever, one day someone told Angela that there was an accident on the road and that Stephen was hurt. Angela ran down the cinder path near our home towards the school crying.\nWhen she got there, she was told he had not waited for the lollipop lady and got a bump from a car. He was physically fine, but Angela was sobbing and so distressed at the thought that Stephen was hurt.\nAngela was so good to Stephen and minded him throughout his childhood. All her friends knew him well because he was like her shadow.\nStephen started to take an interest in birds when he was about 12 years old. He started to study them and could tell you the name of most birds as well as their  eggs. It was also around this time that he became interested in fishing.\nWe had cousins that were avid fishermen and they took him along to Speke Hall, which is a rural setting in a National Trust estate right in the middle of Liverpool. He just loved fishing there and knew all about the fish that lived in the waters there.\nHe seldom, if ever, brought fish home to Mum and Dad. It was a joke in our house about Stephen catching fish, but he preferred to put the fish back into the water.\nWe think it was the birds and the fishing that started Stephen wanted to work out of doors. He appreciated being outdoors.\nHe finished school at 16 years of age and studied for his City and Guilds in Botany and Horticulture. He could name any flower and plant and was perfectly at home with nature.\nHe applied for and got a job with the Liverpool Parks and Gardens based in Calderstones Park. He treasured his job and became a gardener at Sudley Hall in Mossley Hill.\nHe loved his work, the people he worked with, he enjoyed meeting all the visitors and telling them about the gardens.\nWhen Stephen was about 15 years old, he met his girlfriend Jackie. They were very much in love and were engaged to be married when he died.\nStephen knew what he wanted from life. He was very close to our Mum and his main ambition in life was to save enough money to buy our parents a house. He did not want them living in rented accommodation.\nHe was mature and sensible for his age. He took out insurance policies in case anything happened to him, as he wanted our parents to have some money.\nHe was very caring to his nieces and nephews. When Angela's marriage broke down and she was on her own with her two children, Sean and Carla, Stephen with his  girlfriend Jackie would babysit and play with the children, keeping them amused for hours.\nHe could have been out with his mates but knew that Angela needed time alone and his family always came first with him.\nStephen, of course, loved football. His love of football and of Liverpool came from our Dad. The whole family travelled around to watch the matches, but not since 1989.\nAfter 1989, we gave the season tickets back and we never went to a football match again.\nStephen loved to play football as well. He was not the best of players, but he was like an encyclopaedia when it came to anything about football generally.\nStephen was a great music fan. He was always playing Pink Floyd and, in particular, 'Shine on you Crazy Diamond'. He always loved Marillion and went to concerts with his four close friends.\nOur parents never got over Stephen's death and the way he died. Our brother Stephen was one of life's genuine nice guys.\nOur Stephen was just 20 years of age, but had maturity and a caring attitude towards others and even from a young age carried a donor card.\nWe miss Stephen from our family and think about what might have been for all of us as a family if Stephen had not died on that awful day.

The researchers say their figures identify 16,500 children and young people who fit this profile.\nDetails on perpetrators were harder to obtain unless they had actually been arrested, so it is difficult to be sure of their ethnicity, notes the report.\nThe deputy children's commissioner, Sue Berelowitz, said the evidence indicated the perpetrators \"come from all ethnic groups and so do their victims, contrary to what some may wish to believe\".\nShe cautioned the \"model\" of Asian men preying on white girls was just one of \"a number of models\".\n\"The failure of agencies to recognise this means that too many child victims are not getting the protection and support they so desperately need,\" Ms Berelowitz added.\nAnalysis of the reported ethnicity of more than 1,500 alleged perpetrators showed that about a third were white, the largest ethnic group.\n\"The reality is that each year thousands of children in England are raped and abused by people seeking to humiliate, violate and control them,\" said Ms Berelowitz.\n\"These have included children who have been abducted, trafficked, beaten and threatened after being drawn into a web of sexual violence by promises of love, and others who have suffered in silence for years as they are casually and routinely raped by the boys in their neighbourhoods.\"\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that in six out of 10 cases no information was available on ethnicity.\nThe authors say evidence to the inquiry indicates that in any given year the actual number of children being abused is far greater than the 2,409 confirmed in the report.\nThe report found evidence of inconsistent collection of data on child sexual abuse by health services and local authorities, no standardised process across police forces for recording sexual offences by multiple offenders nor of coding sexual offences against children.\n\"At local level this means that both data-sharing and the flagging up of possible cases are disjointed,\" it said.\n\"It is clear that sexually exploited children are not always identified even when they show signs of being victims.\"\nThe report calls for urgent action to protect vulnerable children from all forms of sexual exploitation. All agencies working with children should take immediate action to ensure that their operational staff are made aware of a list of warning signs of sexual exploitation, it says.\nMs Berelowitz urged parents and agencies to be aware of patterns of warning signs, telling the Today programme that agenices should work closely to parents and listen to them.\nA mother and father, whose daughter was groomed and sexually exploited, told Today that parents were often made to feel part of the problem.\nThe mother said: \"What [the authorities] tend to do instead is blame at the worst, or in the very least exclude parents and families.\"\n\"It [grooming] drives a wedge between the child and her family such that she begins to see her abusers, the exploitative men, as her friends and her protectors instead of her family.\"\n\"Parents are assumed to be almost irrelevant or negligent or to have contributed in some way to their children having become victims of sexual exploitation. That simply is not the case.\"\n\"Sexual exploitation can happen to anyone's child\".\nThe father said agencies had to work with families to get better results.\n\"You begin to put the family back together again. Otherwise the effects of grooming is to split the family from top to bottom.\"\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: \"Child sexual exploitation is child abuse and a very serious crime, which the government is committed to tackling.\n\"Since last year the government has been implementing a child sexual exploitation action plan to raise awareness, prosecute and jail criminals, protect young people at risk, and help victims get their lives back on track.\n\"We published a progress report on the action plan in July and will be publishing a further update in due course.\"\nThe plan also focused on improving the recording and sharing of data relating to the identities of victims and abusers, she added.\nHowever a government source privately questioned some of the report's methodology and figures and called some of the language \"hysterical\". The report's authors countered that their use of statistics is sound and their language measured.\nAndrew Flanagan, chief executive of the NSPCC, said: \"Sex offenders come from all backgrounds but if there is a problem with one community in a particular areas we must be bold enough to address it and not just turn a blind eye.\n\"In recent months the NSPCC's specialist teams dedicated to helping children targeted for grooming and sexual exploitation have worked with around 70 girls from a range of ethnic backgrounds with the majority aged between 14 and 16, although some were as young as 11.\"\nCouncillor David Simmons, of the Local Government Association, said: \"It's now vital that councils, the police, the health service and other agencies work more closely, and hand in hand with local communities, to stamp out this disturbing criminal behaviour.\nThe shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, described the report as a \"wake-up call to government\" and called for a clear action plan \"to protect and support these children\".", "prompt": "The Office of Children's Commissioner study says there were 2,409 victims in the 14 months to October 2011 - but the true number"}

{"human": "The Twickenham crowd watched England run in three tries within eight second-half minutes as the home side ran out comprehensive 38-21 winners.\nTheir previous biggest win over New Zealand was 13-0 at Twickenham in January 1936, while the most points they had ever registered against the All Blacks was the 31 they scored at the same venue in November 2002.\nOnly once in 498 Tests had New Zealand been beaten by a bigger margin (28-7). So, what have the pundits got to say about an England victory which very few saw coming?\n\"I can probably see this being maybe the greatest ever England victory, ever, at Twickenham. Nothing is springing to mind where they have annihilated the world's best team as they have today.\n\"I think I have been to every single England game at Twickenham since I was 14. This was by far the best game I've seen.\n\"It's the best performance by an England side considering the opposition and considering what this team has been through, particularly over the last two weeks. This was absolutely magnificent.\n\"Not only has this got to be the greatest game I've seen England play at Twickenham, we've got to put this among one of the world's greatest upsets, maybe even in any sport.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"It was an absolutely astonishing performance to win by 17 points. England harried, hounded and were just relentless. They said to New Zealand 'We will tackle you wherever you go and then we'll pinch the ball and see if we can live off scraps'. New Zealand cracked.\n\"It has been England's day - this is not about today not being New Zealand's day. England have put New Zealand under pressure and they defended not only for their lives but for the 80,000 people inside Twickenham and the millions watching at home. It has been relentless and they gave everything, epitomised by man of the match Tom Wood.\n\"People stepped up. Individuals stepped up one to 15, not just the odd player, particularly in that second half. It was wave after wave of England, whether it was defence or attack. That was the difference.\"\nMatt Dawson was speaking on BBC Radio 5 live.\n\"It was a fantastic Test match played with great energy. This England team has had a lot of flak over the past couple of weeks and they've got a lot of pride back in the shirt.\n\"The crowd just buzzed off it and it was wonderful to be here.\n\"What I liked about the start was that when England walked on the field there wasn't a lot of song and dance about it, they knew they had to do a job and they took the game to New Zealand.\n\"I said beforehand, if you're going to beat the best teams in the world, indeed become the best in the world, you've got to have self-belief and for me they played with that self-belief today. They took the game to New Zealand and deserved the victory.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"Looking at the first half, New Zealand will rue a couple of those missed penalties but psychologically England just built it and built it.\n\"There was still room to improve - Ashton missed an opportunity in the corner, Tuilagi forced the ball - but this team today gelled. They got opportunities and took them - to me that's what Test match rugby is about.\n\"It's very easy to look back at the past but England's 31-28 win against the All Blacks in 2002 was the day we actually said 'we are the top team in the world'. It was a massive transformation from which England then built for the next few years.\n\"Hopefully we'll look back at this day not just as a great day for English rugby, but the day this team really grew up.\"\nJosh Lewsey was speaking on BBC Three.\n\"Absolutely unbelievable. Not just to get the victory, but the best victory England have ever had against the All Blacks. No-one saw it coming, but maybe this England team did.\n\"They played absolutely magnificently well, not just scoring penalties to build the score in the first half, but try after try in the second half. It was quite extraordinary.\n\"Chris Robshaw was a hero - he deserves all the credit he will get. In the same way England were lambasted in defeat, when they play well - which they did, they were heroic - they should take a huge round of applause.\n\"They got themselves 15-0 up and then conceded two soft tries, but the way they came back at New Zealand was so impressive.\n\"The All Blacks looked shell-shocked at the end.\"\nLawrence Dallaglio was speaking on BBC Three\n\"It was a fantastic win. It was a great to be there, one of best games I ever seen at Twickenham.\n\"It was the All Blacks against England who were coming off two average defeats. The scoreline reflected the performance. It was a great day for England.\n\"I think because it was the last of the games in the series and what happened in the match means it was a David versus Goliath effort.\n\"England got stuck into New Zealand early on and they were rattled. A key point was when Conrad Smith came flying out and England went through.\n\"New Zealand never recovered from that.

{"human": "On a night when Wembley paid its respects to the late Dutch legend Johan Cruyff with applause in the 14th minute, a much-changed England side slipped to a rare defeat at the national stadium.\nMan-of-the-match Jamie Vardy rounded off a slick passing move to steer in Kyle Walker's cross four minutes before the interval - but Roy Hodgson's side could not protect their lead.\nEngland's defence lived on the edge too often and were eventually punished when a sloppy passage of play led to Danny Rose handling, and Vincent Janssen scored from the spot after 50 minutes.\nThe big striker was then too strong for substitute Phil Jagielka, although England complained bitterly he had been fouled, before crossing for Luciano Narsingh to score the winner 13 minutes from  time.\nVardy's transition from the heights he has scaled with Leicester City this season to England has been seamless - and he has stepped up a level in the two friendlies against Germany and the Netherlands.\nThe 29-year-old has been portrayed as both an ideal starter and the perfect impact substitute as Hodgson makes plans for Euro 2016.\nVardy has proved his capabilities for both, with an explosive 20-minute cameo in Berlin that included a brilliantly instinctive finish as part of England's comeback.\nAnd here, he was England's outstanding performer by some distance, showing the pace and energy that has panicked Premier League defences and also skill to round off that passing move with a clinical finish before testing Dutch keeper Jeroen Zoet with a powerful rising drive.\nThe debate about how best to use Vardy may go on but one thing is beyond dispute - he is going to Euro 2016 and has the ability to threaten every defence in France.\nIn an ideal world, Everton's John Stones would have come in at Wembley to produce the sort of elegant display that became his trademark in the early seasons of his career, thus cementing his place alongside Chris Smalling for England's first Euro 2016 game against Russia in Marseille.\nInstead, Wembley witnessed a 21-year-old whose confidence has been hit by a recent dip in form at club level and will need a little renovating before the serious action gets under way.\nStones twice brought murmurs of concern from England's fans inside Wembley with his tendency to perhaps over-play out of defence, but his determination to be constructive also started the passing move that led to Vardy's goal.\nThe young defender is a work in progress and there will be slips - quite literally when he stumbled at the start of a chain of events that led to England keeper Fraser Forster having to save well from Janssen before Rose handled to leave the striker to score from the spot.\nStones is well worth persevering with - but Hodgson must hope some of that confidence and composure returns quickly.\nHodgson warned they must not get carried away after victory in Germany - and, in case anyone ignored the warning, along comes a defeat against a Dutch team that will not even be in France this summer.\nIn some respects this defeat, albeit with a much-changed side, simply reinforced some of the lessons that came out of the win in Germany that was the catalyst for such a surge of optimism.\nEngland have some very exciting options up front in the shape of Vardy and Harry Kane, while Daniel Sturridge also got a decent 57 minutes under his belt.\nQuestions remain, however, about a frail-looking defence with both full-back spots still up for grabs and no central-defensive pairing jumping out as Hodgson's first choice at this stage.\nEngland certainly carry a threat but fears persist about their ability to resist attacks of the highest calibre.\nFraser Forster: Solid night for the Southampton keeper despite a couple of fumbles. Saved well from Georginio Wijnaldum and Vincent Janssen. Clear deputy to Joe Hart. 7.\nKyle Walker: Solid and quick in defence and a threat in attack with a perfect pass for Vardy to score England's goal. 7.\nChris Smalling: Part of an uncertain central-defensive partnership that once again hinted at England's frailty against attacks possessing real quality. 6.\nJohn Stones: Not a great night for Everton's 21-year-old. Yes, his determination to play started the move for England's goal but too often caused anxiety with his tendency to overdo things and second-half slip started chain of events that led to the Dutch equaliser. 5.\nDanny Rose: Not an easy night for England's defence but Rose kept going and may consider himself unlucky to be punished for the handball that led to a penalty. 6.\nJames Milner: Anonymous as England's captain. Milner is a solid presence but not big on inspirational moments. 5.\nDanny Drinkwater: Solid debut from the Leicester City midfielder. Did himself no harm and can be happy with his debut but did he make a compelling case for inclusion in Euro 2016? Not sure. 6.\nRoss Barkley: Busy first half and a trademark second-half surge that set up a chance for Adam Lallana. 6.\nAdam Lallana: Decent night for the Liverpool midfielder. Clever pass played its part in England's goal and was warmly applauded when substituted. 7.\nDaniel Sturridge: Once he'd stopped fiddling with his bootlaces he settled down and produced one or two moments that hint at the threat he could yet pose for England. 6.\nJamie Vardy: England's star man. Busy, scored one and could have had another. 8.\nSubstitutes:\nWalcott (for Sturridge, 57 minutes): Odd flash of pace and one rising shot over the bar but otherwise quiet. 6.\nClyne (for Rose, 57 minutes): Not much of an opportunity and consequently not much impact. 5.\nKane (for Lallana, 70 minutes): Just a couple of half-chances but no rescue act from the man who is now England's first-choice striker. 5.\nJagielka (for Smalling, 70 minutes): Claimed he was fouled by Janssen in the lead-up to the winner but should have been stronger in that situation. 5.\nAlli (for Milner, 82 minutes): No rating.\nDier (for Drinkwater, 84 minutes): No rating.\nThe Three Lions wait until 21 May to host Turkey, while Netherlands meet Republic of Ireland six days later.\nMatch ends, England 1, Netherlands 2.\nSecond Half ends, England 1, Netherlands 2.\nFoul by Dele Alli (England).\nIbrahim Afellay (Netherlands) wins a free kick in the defensive half.\nSubstitution, Netherlands.

German troops occupied Estonia during World War II, before being driven out by the Soviet army.\nFew nations formally recognised the Soviet annexation, and Estonians consider it an illegal occupation.\nOne of its legacies is a large Russian minority - about a quarter of the population, according to the 2011 census. In Soviet times, the influx of non-Estonians led some to fear for the survival of Estonian culture and language.\nThe Russians' status has been a cause of controversy. Some, including the Russian government, criticise requirements needed to obtain Estonian citizenship - especially the need to show a proficiency in the Estonian language - that left most ethnic Russians stateless after independence.\nEstonia says the criteria for citizenship are similar to those of most nations around the world, and have been in any case gradually eased. It says the number of stateless persons has dropped by 80% between 1992 and 2013.\nSince independence, Estonia has politically and economically anchored itself firmly to the West, joining the EU and Nato in 2004. It sent a contingent of troops as part of Nato operations in Afghanistan.\nRussia's intervention in the Ukrainian crisis in 2014 has triggered some nervousness in Estonia over President Vladimir Putin's intentions towards other former Soviet states. The Estonian government has been fiercely critical of Russia's behaviour and has affirmed its pro-Nato stance in response to the events in Ukraine.\nEstonian governments have tended to pursue strongly free-market economic policies, privatising state enterprises, introducing a flat-rate income tax, liberalising regulation, encouraging free trade and keeping public debt low.\nThere has also been a strong emphasis on making Estonia a world leader in technology, leading some to speak of an \"e-economy\".\nThis has included creating one of the world's fastest broadband networks, offering widespread free wireless internet, encouraging technology start-ups and putting government services online. In 2007, Estonia was the first country to allow online voting in a general election.\nThe country experienced an investment boom in the early 2000s, especially after EU membership, with high annual growth rates hovering between 7-10%.\nIn 2008, Estonia's economy was hit by the global financial crisis. The government adopted tough austerity measures and won plaudits for getting the economy back into shape.\nThe country joined the European single currency in January 2011.\nThe Estonian language is closely related to Finnish and - more distantly - Hungarian, but not to the Indo-European languages of the two other Baltic states - Latvia and Lithuania - or Russian for that matter.\nThe country has unique musical and dance traditions, including a long tradition of choral singing.", "prompt": "Since regaining its independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Estonia has become one of the most economically successful of the European Union"}

Ministers have said it involves \"compliance with the letter but not the spirit of the law\".\nIn recent years it emerged that companies and individuals had been greatly reducing their liabilities by making use of legal tax shelter schemes.\nMeanwhile the \"tax gap\" - the difference between the amount of tax owed and collected - rose to Â£34bn in the year to April 2013.\nThe government's so-called general anti-abuse rule (GAAR) came into force in July 2013, after Chancellor George Osborne described aggressive tax avoidance - as well as illegal tax evasion - as \"morally repugnant\".\nIt aimed to \"deter taxpayers from entering into abusive arrangements, and to deter would-be promoters from promoting such arrangements\".\nThe rule is a broad set of principles designed to prevent tax avoidance, to avoid having constantly to introduce new legislation to tackle individual loopholes.\nLabour has previously said it would increase transparency in the tax system and prevent dormant companies from trading without paying tax.\nIt has pledged to use some of the money raised from a tax avoidance crackdown for its Â£2.5bn NHS funding pledge.\nMr Balls said Labour had supported the introduction of the anti-abuse rule, but said it was \"without teeth\".\nHe said: \"Those who are caught have to repay the tax they tried to avoid, but they do not face a penalty.

From there on, flat setups began crashing into flubbed punchlines with the alacrity of a drunk sailor inviting the entire pub to have a go if they think they're hard enough.\nThere was a predictable joke about Harvey Weinstein (there always is); a bit where he started to talk to the seat fillers and then seemed to immediately lose heart; a routine about his Oscar predictions so laboured it was on the verge of setting up its own union.\nBy halfway through there was terror in Harris' eyes whenever the camera came to him. A part where he asked David Oyelowo to read an insult about the remake of Annie - which had recast the lead with a black actress - was fist-gnawingly uncomfortable.\nIt's worth noting, however, that it was this undercurrent of racial politics that gave the night its most memorable moments.\nOyelowo was in tears as he listened to the performance of Glory by John Legend and Common from Selma. It was an intense, powerful performance which had the entire audience on their feet as it finished.\nWhen Glory shortly afterwards gained Legend and Common (under their real names of John Stephens and Lonnie Lynn) the best song trophy, they electrified with a passionate joint speech.\n\"Nina Simone said it was an artist's duty to reflect the times we live. Selma may be 50 years ago, but it is now, because the struggle for justice is right now,\" they insisted, and the music that normally strikes up to urge the winners off the stage stayed silent.\nIndeed it was a night for politics. Best Actress Patricia Arquette called for equality for women; Best Adapted Screenplay winner Graham Moore urged young people confused about their sexuality to \"stay weird\"; Best Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu spoke about the Mexicans \"who came before and built this incredible immigrant nation\".\nMeanwhile, at the end - in every sense - Harris fluffed a gag about mispronouncing Chiwetel Ejiofor's name.\nIn the context of what had preceded it, it struck a particularly flat note. The Oscars aren't going to stop being seen as white and elitist if every year the writers insist on mining this seam of \"exotic names are weird and hard to say.\"\nThat is hardly Harris' fault. Nevertheless, it really did highlight the contrast of the night: That between black politics and white pants.", "prompt": "Just as David Letterman had his painfully awkward \"Uma, Oprah\" routine and Seth Macfarlane his catastrophically misjudged song We"}

The striker, with 27 goals in the league this season, had only just returned to the side after missing last week's draw with Malaga, and he lasted just 14 minutes before his hamstring went after a brief sprint.\nCosta limped off in tears and just seven minutes later it got worse for the visitors. Arda Turan, so often the creator of Atletico's better moves this season, landed on his back awkwardly when challenging for possession and he too was unable to continue.\nTo Atletico's credit, they did not let that double blow disrupt them as they managed to keep Barcelona at arm's length, whilst also threatening occasionally themselves.\nAtletico's Tiago directed a header over the bar from Koke's inviting cross, before Pedro missed with a similar attempt for Barcelona soon after.\nThere had barely been a shot on target in the first half hour but it was a moment of brilliance from Sanchez that gave Barcelona the lead.\nCesc Fabregas curled a ball into the box for Lionel Messi who, with his back to goal, chested the ball into the path of an onrushing Sanchez, who smashed a first time effort from the tightest of angles just inside the top right of the Atletico goal.\nThe half-time whistle provided Simeone the chance to offer words of encouragement to his players, and whatever he said evidently worked as the visitors made a storming start to the second half.\nVilla's shot on the turn struck the post, before the former Barcelona striker saw a low, left-footed effort saved by Pinto, but their pressure paid dividends just five minutes after the restart when Gabi whipped a corner into the middle of the area where Godin rose highest to send a bullet header low into the back of the net.\nBarcelona needed to regain the initiative if they were to successfully defend the league title and the balance of play quickly swung back in their favour, with the visitors seemingly content to soak up pressure and try and hit the hosts on the counter.\nMessi, quiet for large periods of the game, had the ball in the net midway through the second half, but the Argentine's effort was ruled offside, before Alves struck a shot from distance that seemed destined for the top corner, only for Atletico keeper Thibaut Courtois to react superbly to push the ball over his goal.\nThe Atletico players held their nerve to keep Barcelona at bay in the final 10 minutes before the final whistle confirmed their status as league champions.\nWith one trophy secured, Simeone will now switch his attention to the Champions League, with Atletico taking on Real Madrid in the final on Saturday, 24 May.", "prompt": "Striker Diego Costa went off injured for Atletico early on and Barcelona capitalised as Alexis Sanchez smashed in a superb opener.\nAtletico came"}

Scotland's population is expected to grow more slowly than that of the UK in the coming years, which could impact on the economy north of the border.\nMs Sturgeon said the Treasury seemed to be trying to argue in terms of what detriment should be imposed on Scotland, and her spokesman later described the UK government's position on the matter as \"increasingly isolated\".\nOutlining his latest proposal to his Treasury counterpart Greg Hands, Mr Swinney said taxpayers in the rest of the UK \"are no better or worse off\" under his terms.\nHe said: \"Under the Scottish government's method, taxpayers in the rest of the UK will see no detriment.

But research into the agency's work, as well as revelations by former CIA employees, has thrown up several cases where the agency tried to influence events.\nHere are four examples:\nPatrice Lumumba became the first prime minister of the newly-independent Congo in 1960, but he lasted just a few months in the job before he was overthrown and assassinated in January 1961.\nIn 2002, former colonial power Belgium admitted responsibility for its part in the killing, however, the US has never explained its role despite long-held suspicions.\nUS President Dwight D Eisenhower, concerned about communism, was worried about Congo following a similar path to Cuba.\nAccording to a source quoted in Death in the Congo, a book about the assassination, President Eisenhower gave \"an order for the assassination of Lumumba. There was no discussion; the [National Security Council] meeting simply moved on\".\nHowever, a CIA plan to lace Lumumba's toothpaste with poison was never carried out, Lawrence Devlin, who was a station chief in Congo at the time, told the BBC in 2000.\nA survey of declassified US government documents from the era notes that the CIA \"initially focussed on removing Lumumba, not only through assassination if necessary but also with an array of non-lethal undertakings\".\nWhile there is no doubt the CIA wanted him dead, the survey does not indicate direct US involvement in his eventual killing.\nGhana's first President Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown in a military coup in 1966 while he was out of the country.\nHe later suspected that the US had a role in his downfall and in a 1978 book, former CIA intelligence officer John Stockwell backed this theory up.\nIn In Search of Enemies he writes that an official sanction for the coup does not appear in CIA documents, but he writes \"the Accra station was nevertheless encouraged by headquarters to maintain contact with dissidents.\n\"It was given a generous budget, and maintained intimate contact with the plotters as a coup was hatched.\"\nHe says that the CIA in Ghana got more involved and its operatives were given \"unofficial credit for the eventual coup\".\nA declassified US government document does show awareness of a plot to overthrow the president, but does not indicate any official backing.\nAnother declassified document written after the coup describes Nkrumah's fall as a \"fortuitous windfall. Nkrumah was doing more to undermine our interests than any other black African\".\nIn Angola three competing groups fought for control after independence from Portugal in 1975, with the MPLA under Agostinho Neto taking over the capital Luanda.\nMr Stockwell, chief of CIA's covert operations in Angola in 1975, writes that Washington decided to oppose the MPLA, as it was seen as closer to the Soviet Union, and support the FNLA and Unita instead, even though all three had help from communist countries.\nThe CIA then helped secretly import weapons, including 30,000 rifles, through Kinshasa in neighbouring Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr Stockwell says in a video documentary.\nHe adds that CIA officers also trained fighters for armed combat.\nA declassified US government document detailing a discussion between the head of the CIA, the secretary of state and others indicates the support the CIA gave to the forces fighting the MPLA.\nThe US continued to support Unita through much of the civil war as Cuba was backing the MPLA.\nHissene Habre failed in his attempt to take power by force in Chad in 1980.\nBut his efforts led President Goukouni Oueddei to call on help from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, whose soldiers successfully beat back Habre's challenge and forced him into exile.\nA proposed alliance between Libya and Chad began to unsettle the US especially as Gaddafi began to be seen as a supporter of anti-US activities.\nIn Foreign Policy magazine Michael Bronner writes that the CIA director, with the secretary of state, \"coalesced around the idea of launching a covert war in partnership with Habre\".\nIt is alleged that the US then backed Habre's overthrow of the president in 1982 and then supported him throughout his brutal rule.", "prompt": "Most incidents came during the Cold War, when the US and the Soviet Union battled for influence across the continent.\nCIA covert operations are by their very"}

{"human": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nBut the tagline - Alter Your Reality - could easily be used to promote the fight between Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather, which will dominate the sporting landscape this weekend.\nThus far it has engendered a mix of intrigue and revulsion from observers. Whether you like it or not, this is a sporting event that cannot be ignored.\nLas Vegas is a city that constantly beguiles visitors into altering their perceptions - and, at times, their common sense - in a haze of hedonistic pleasures. Mayweather v McGregor, with its unabashed glorification of money, image and bravado, fits perfectly within the daily excesses of the world's gambling capital.\nSaturday's fight will pit a man widely considered one of the greatest exponents of his sport against a mixed martial artist who has never boxed professionally.\nThe outcome should be simple to determine, no matter McGregor's mantra and hubristic claim he is ready to \"shock the world\".\nBut remember this is Vegas. And many believe McGregor's sleight of hand against an ageing Mayweather could provide a major upset. It will be no illusion if he does win, ranking as one of the greatest shocks in sporting history.\nThe debate as to who will triumph will sway back and forth in the coming days - pumped up, no doubt, by yet more hateful invective from the two chief protagonists.\nThe true verdict can only be delivered in the ring, in what is likely to be the richest fight in boxing history.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nTickets for the venue have not yet sold out - but with an expected five million pay-per-view purchases, the cash will cascade in from those sitting watching at home and at venues around the world.\nThe smell of money permeates the Las Vegas strip at the best of times. This week, the stench is inescapable.\nBoth fighters and their camps have been candid in admitting the contest is all about the cash. However, the language they have used to boost their mega pay day has been disgraceful.\nA five-city publicity tour in July became a nauseating race to the bottom as each man tried to find fresh insults to hurl at one another.\nHomophobic put-downs, and racially motivated slurs and stereotypes have soured the build-up to this contest. It was difficult not to wince when McGregor turned to his opponent on the final leg of the tour at Wembley and told him to \"dance for me, boy\".\nHowever, both men are equally culpable given their behaviour.\nDana White, the UFC president who is representing McGregor, believes it is all justified.\n\"It's funny when people say they've taken this thing too far,\" he said.\n\"This is a fight, not a croquet game. This part of the deal; the reality is what's going on here is just as much part of the fight as the fight itself, the mental warfare game.\"\nIt is at this point the true reality of this contest has not been altered but frankly obliterated.\nContext is everything and this fight is not taking place in a vacuum. The US is scarred and still reeling from recent events in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white supremacists marched with burning torches and gave Nazi salutes.\nIt is a country still deeply fractured along racial lines.\nIt is a country where prejudice - and the fight against it in all its forms - is a near constant part of the national conversation.\nIn their own small way, both Mayweather and McGregor, with every hateful word uttered, are expanding the pool of division that already exists in this country.\nSurely sport should be the place where differences can be set aside? This contest provides an opportunity for examples to be set but it has, so far, been wasted.\nTrash talk and one-upmanship is one thing. It has always been a part of prize fighting.\nLanguage that divides and excludes - that seemingly legitimises homophobic, sexist and racist behaviour - is something else entirely.\nThey certainly aren't the first boxers to trade in such terms.\nThough both men later apologised, Manny Pacquaio shamefully called people in same-sex marriages \"worse than animals\", while Tyson Fury expressed a Neanderthal view that a woman's best place is \"on her back or in the kitchen\".\nThe truth is boxing offers girls and boys a chance to build self-esteem, to train and dedicate themselves to a higher goal. It provides hope, and often an escape, for many.\nYou just have to listen to Mike Costello and Steve Bunce's recent podcast from the burnt-out Grenfell Tower to see what boxing can do for a community. The building housed a gym with volunteer coaches, all unpaid, giving their time and knowledge to help transform lives. The hope is it can rise again.\nBut some of the most powerful men at the top of the sport have failed time and again to see the gift they possess to inspire and encourage everyone, of all backgrounds, to get involved.\nMayweather and McGregor, cosseted in their elite world of Lamborghinis, Louis Vuitton luggage and flashy Las Vegas nightspots, appear to have forgotten this too.\nTheir humble beginnings at gyms in Michigan and Dublin respectively should serve as a reminder of the chances they were provided with.\nTheir respective combat sports have given them untold riches. This week their bank accounts will swell further.\nWith no boxing federation overseeing the bout and the Nevada State Athletic Commission - which sanctioned the fight - refusing to get involved, both Mayweather and McGregor can act however they wish.\nEven the UFC, in which McGregor made his name, has allowed the Irishman's actions to go unchecked of late. His volatile behaviour before recent events has seen him throw bottles and even try to hurl a chair at an opponent.\nThere is arguably a responsibility for the two most recognisable figures in combat sports to be more guarded with their words and to realise they are custodians; to extol the virtues of the sport that has given them everything.\nTheir most dangerous weapons, it seems, are not their fists but their tongues.\nNo-one expects them to be angels - the true, unaltered reality this week is they have a fight to sell and money to make. And on Saturday a truly intriguing sporting contest will take place.\nHowever, the orgy of excess that surrounds it threatens to further sully a sport that right now needs all the help it can get to maintain popularity and relevance.\nWhat happens in Vegas should, according to the old saying, stay in Vegas. Hopefully that also applies to the hateful rhetoric of this unavoidable fight.", "prompt": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nBut the tagline - Alter Your Reality - could easily be used to promote the fight between Conor McGregor and"}

{"human": "While $50m is the starting point for serious wealth, \"in reality your spending power and investing power really gets to the next level when you get to around $100m\", says Catherine Tillotson.\nMs Tillotson is joint managing partner of Scorpio Partnership, a London-based firm which advises the super-rich on how to manage their assets, and she says there is a reason for this dividing line between the wealthy elite and the rest of us.\n\"This is the point at which families will start to think about employing people purely to help them manage their financial affairs,\" she says.\nThere may now be more multi-millionaires and billionaires than ever before in the world, but since the 2008 global financial crisis the wealth gap between the world's top 1% and the rest of us has grown.\nThis increasingly stark division between haves and have-nots is leading to increasing rancour towards the very wealthy, say many social commentators.\nRobert Kuhn is better placed than many to understand this hostility - a former investment banker and corporate strategist, he is himself among the world's wealthy elite.\nThe world is getting wealthier - we live longer, eat better, are better educated and fewer people live in extreme poverty.\nBut with the gap between rich and poor feeling bigger than ever, the BBC is investigating the winners and losers of this richer world in 2015.\nA Richer World 2015\n\"I think much of it is justified,\" he says, perhaps surprisingly, \"and I think we should describe why that's the case.\"\nOne of the main reasons for this, he says, is the web. \"We have a very highly wired world with the internet, people are more aware of things - and I think that's a good thing.\"\nMr Kuhn is coy about his own net worth. When asked if it is \"tens of millions\" of dollars, he replies, \"I would not like to be too specific, but I wouldn't contradict what you just said.\"\nTrained as a neuroscientist, Mr Kuhn became an investment banker and then in the early 1990s sold his mergers and acquisitions firm \"at the right time\".\nHe says he worked hard, \"but if I don't acknowledge there was a lot of luck involved I would be fooling myself\".\nHe wants to encourage more and more people to become wealthy, but also to place limits on the amount of wealth that can be passed on to the next generation.\n\"That gives each generation a chance to have higher social mobility.\"\nBut given that the gap between rich and poor has reached its widest level for 30 years in most developed countries, according to says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) group of developed nations - that social mobility is getting harder for many.\nIn the 1980s, the richest 10% had incomes seven times greater than the poorest 10% in the average industrialised country.\nNow, in those same countries, the richest have incomes nine-and-a half times greater than the poorest, on average. The actual figures vary widely across the 34 OECD's member states.\nIn Denmark the top 10% earn about five times more than the bottom 10% - in Mexico they earn 30 times as much.\nHow much more do the top 10% earn than the bottom 10%?\nSource: OECD (2011)\nOther organisations, too, are highlighting this discrepancy between rich and poor. A report this month from the charity Oxfam says the world's wealthiest 1% will own more than 50% of the world's wealth by 2016.\n\"This is something that we should be very worried about,\" says Mark Pearson, the OECD's deputy director of employment, labour and social affairs.\nIf countries want to boost their economic growth, then they need to take steps to narrow this wealth gap, says the OECD.\nThis goes against the longstanding free market argument that rising wealth at the top will trickle down to everybody else.\nBut, the OECD research suggest that the reverse is true. \"Our finding is that by reducing income inequality, you can boost economic growth,\" Mr Pearson told BBC World Service's Business Daily programme.\nAn increasing wealth gap hinders economic growth because it limits investment in a country's labour force, argues the OECD.\nPoorer people cannot afford to spend as much as the rich can on their children's education.\nAnd that lack of investment in education means a less educated and less flexible workforce in the long run, says the group in its research.\nIt is not just the super-rich that are doing well - those whose business is dealing with super-rich customers are profiting too.\nAlex Cheatle is chief executive of Ten Group, a lifestyle concierge service that can helps its clients get that exclusive restaurant table, sell-out theatre ticket - or finds that vintage sports car in a particular colour.\nTen will even do your window-shopping for you, if you are too rich or famous to be able to do it yourself.\n\"Very often they will want us to take a picture of the window and get it to them, so they do their window shopping as and when they want to,\" says Mr Cheatle.\n\"There hasn't really been a crisis for many of our members. Business is booming for us, we've grown every year since 2008 - growing at an average rate of 25-30% a year.\"\nWhen you consider how much the super-rich spend, that growth is perhaps not surprising.\nOver the course of a year, it's reckoned the world's top 1% spend a staggering $45bn (£30bn) on travel and hospitality, $40bn (£26bn) on cars, and $25bn (£16bn) each on art, jewellery and watches.\nOr course, the ultimate statement of wealth is to have your own super-yacht - complete with helicopter pad, speedboat tenders and even a submarine or two.\nThe world's biggest such boat is currently the Azzam, 180m (590ft) long, launched in 2013 at a reported cost of up to $600m (£400m) - and the sector has certainly weathered the global slowdown better than many others.\nSource: Boat International\nSo with the wealth gap rising should the rich pay more tax, and if so would that help?\nRobert Kuhn - now business and financial commentator - argues that countries that decide to increase taxes on the rich may not see any benefit.\nHe believes increasing income taxes to too high a level would \"inhibit the creation of new wealth which is detrimental to society\".\n\"I'm just worried about the behaviour and implications if you put too high a tax rate, what that will do to current generations in their energy and focus to create new wealth,\" says Mr Kuhn.\nAt Scipio Partnership, Catherine Tillotson says that focussing on tax misses out the contributions made by many rich patrons to philanthropic and charitable causes.\n\"The tax question is hugely complicated,\" she says.\n\"Most families that I've met will say that it is absolutely critical to them that they pay the right amount of tax according to the rules.\"\nHowever, \"in many ways those dollars spent on philanthropic passions may be doing more good than they would have done in the tax system\", she says.\nYet ever since the financial crisis of 2008, and subsequent global economic slowdown, politicians have come under increasing pressure to increase tax contributions from the richest in their societies.\nProtest movements such as Occupy Wall Street, which started in 2011 and has since spread to many other countries, have highlighted concern over social and economic inequality worldwide.\nFor his part, Robert Kuhn is not convinced that a widening wealth gap matters in economic terms, but \"it matters in social stability for sure\", he agrees.\n\"It matters in terms of social mobility of subsequent generations.\"\n\"To me that's the biggest problem, for any country,\" he says. \"And many countries are facing that.\"\nClick here for more from BBC's A Richer World, a season exploring the world's wealth, poverty and inequality", "prompt": "While $50m is the starting point for serious wealth, \"in reality your spending power and investing power really gets to the next level when you get"}

Of the 28 who died, 18 were either passengers in the suspect vehicle or other road users.\nDoes the rise simply reflect an upsurge in criminal activity? Is it because suspects have become increasingly reckless? Or have police standards on the roads slipped?\nThe IPCC and the National Police Chiefs' Council will have to get to the bottom of it quickly.\nDame Anne Owers, chairwoman of the IPCC, said the six fatal shootings occurred across six forces.\nThe shooting of Khalid Masood was the only one related to terrorism.\nThe watchdog said the investigation into that case and two others had been completed and all three found no evidence of any misconduct by firearms officers.\nIn addition, another inquiry, which is still ongoing, is also yet to find any evidence of wrongdoing by police.\nInvestigations into two other shootings are still to conclude.\nThe National Police Chiefs Council and the IPCC will examine whether changes to police pursuit safety or training are needed after the rise in road traffic deaths, added Dame Anne.\nThe IPPC data also showed there were 14 deaths in police custody - the second lowest figure it has recorded.\nEight of the 14 people who died were reported to have mental health problems.", "prompt": "The Independent Police Complaints Commission said there were six fatal police shootings between April 2016 to March 2017, up from three in 201"}

{"human": "Named after Japanese sword-smith Muramasa Sengo, the Guernsey-born musician comes armed with deft beats, exotic instrumentation and heartbreaking lyrics.\nLike his namesake, he says he wants the music \"to cut like a knife\".\nOnly 19 years old, he has already created a strong body of original material, incorporating Asian soundscapes (Shakuhachi flutes, thumb pianos) into his glitchy electronica.\nHis most recent track, Love For That, is a sumptuous, string-drenched ballad which found its way onto the BBC 1Xtra playlist after being played more than a million times on SoundCloud.\nThe musician, whose real name is Alex Crossan, talked to the BBC from the flatshare in Brighton where he records all of his music.\nCongratulations on making the top five Sound of 2016. How does it feel?\nSort of baffling. It's an honour, but it's scary and exciting.\nYou grew up in Guernsey, which isn't a place that's renowned for cutting-edge dance music.\nThere was a footballer, Matt Le Tissier, from Guernsey. But as far as music, no, not many people have come out of there.\nDid that sense of isolation from the music scene help you develop your own sound?\nI think so. If you grew up in London's East End you'd probably be inclined to be into something like grime music. But if you're removed from it, like in Guernsey, you can have a wider set of influences, and you're not tied down to any genre or any scene. I think that affects my sound, for sure.\nWhat sort of music did you grow up listening to?\nAt a young age, I was introduced to Joni Mitchell by my mum. My dad was into progressive rock. But when YouTube came around in 2005 or 2006, suddenly all the music was available and you just had to do your own research.\nThere's a strong oriental theme to your music - how did you work out those sounds and scales and styles of playing?\nJust a lot of time and patience, really. A lot of people say they're influenced by things, but they don't actually listen to what's happening in the music.\nIf you do your homework properly before you try and write it becomes simple.\nDid you have musical training?\nI started playing violin when I was about five years old and I learned to read a little bit of music, but that's all been long, long forgotten! I actually quit violin to teach myself guitar and just went from there.\nDo you remember the first song you produced?\nOh gosh. It was a really, really terrible dubstep track. It had a sample of Robin Williams in it shouting \"Gooooood Morning Vietnam!\" It was awful.\nYou started uploading music to the internet very quickly. What was the impetus for that?\nBecause I'm from Guernsey, I couldn't swap music with many people. I had a couple of friends who were making music but I think online was just the natural way for me to get heard. I come from the internet generation, so it kind of made sense. There wasn't any deep thought put into it.\nThe first track I uploaded was called Death Grips - but it doesn't exist any more. I deleted it because it's so bad!\nWhen did you first realise people were taking notice?\nI put out a mix tape at the end of last year called Soundtrack To A Death and it was just a beat tape - but Jo Whiley played it on Radio 2, and then Huw Stephens made it album of the week on Radio 1. It was all very strange.\nBut I think that was when I started developing my own sound and I think people started tuning in to that.\nHow would you describe that sound?\nGosh, this is always the question I dread! But it takes everything that I love about hip-hop and electronic music and mashes it together in the setting of lo-fi, oriental-influenced beat music.\nIs the flute part in Lotus Eater a sample?\nI wrote that, actually.\nThat's incredible. It sounds like its come from a dusty old piece of vinyl.\nThat's what's great about it, I think, because you can write a part and retroactively make it lo-fi and make it sound like a sample. That's something I love doing.\nThat song would fit perfectly on a film soundtrack - specifically a Quentin Tarantino film. Do you approach music visually?\nFor definite. I didn't start writing my debut album until I'd sorted the cover art. It's an intrinsic part of the whole process. The first music I really loved was Gorillaz and I think the way the visuals played into the music and told a story was very important to me.\nIt's funny you should mention Tarantino. I have two posters in my room - one's of the White Stripes and the other one is Pulp Fiction.\nThe strings on Love For That really emphasise the emotions of the song. Are they live instruments?\nYeah they are - and I think I'm going to be doing that a lot more on the album. It just makes it quite special hearing the bow moving on the strings.\nIt's cool to make people remember that, although electronic music is obviously produced electronically, it's still real music.\nYour album is due out in the first couple of months of 2016. Is it finished?\nI'm about half-way done. The way I work, everything tends to come together last minute. It's called To Fall Out Of Love To and it's got a story arc to it.\nIs it a concept album?\nErmâ€¦ yeah. But to me, whenever I hear the words \"concept album\", it means the music isn't that good but there's a really cool idea behind it. I want to hit the target of really good music and really meaningful lyrical content.\nYou've already been played on daytime radio - is the ambition to crossover into the mainstream?\nIf you go into this expecting a number one single then you're a pop artist - and I don't think I am a pop artistâ€¦ yet.\nAt the end of the day, my personal ambition is just to make really, really, really good music that's culturally relevant and stands the test of time. That's all I want.", "prompt": "Named after Japanese sword-smith Muramasa Sengo, the Guernsey-born musician comes armed with deft beats, exotic instrumentation and heartbreaking lyrics"}
{"human": "She found time to visit Mount Vesuvius and the ancient Roman city of Pompeii, she took her friends to the villa they had hired... and then she received an email from her agent with news of a wildcard into the US Open qualifying draw, and promptly headed back to the airport.\nForty-eight hours earlier, Robson had won her first tournament since the age of 14 - capturing the ITF title in Landisville, Pennsylvania. It was by far and away her biggest triumph since first feeling the effects of a wrist injury in the late summer of 2013.\nShe played only two events in the whole of 2014, and in April of that year underwent surgery on her dominant left wrist in Minnesota. Her recovery was a slow, painful and very frustrating process. She next played competitively at the Eastbourne qualifying event of June 2015.\nBy this time Robson had forfeited her WTA ranking. She was playing on a 12 month long protected ranking of 58 (the position she held at her last event before injury: the 2014 Australian Open) and the comeback was a very stilted affair. Other minor injuries held her back as she hit the practice courts hard and it is only since the start of this year that she has been totally free of pain in the wrist.\nRobson's progress in the first six months of this year was unspectacular.\nAt the back of your mind you're not quite sure if your body is going to break down or if it's properly healed\nShe has won only one tour level match since her return - and that came against an unranked Moroccan teenager in the first round of the WTA event in Rabat; she was soundly beaten by Andrea Petkovic at the French Open, and Angelique Kerber at Wimbledon.\nBut then, after dispiriting trips to minor tournaments in Fort Worth, Lexington and Sacramento in which she collected five ranking points and earned barely one thousand dollars, Robson won five matches in a row in Landisville - including the final without dropping a game.\nThe $3,919 in prize money was irrelevant, but the 50 ranking points helped her climb back into the world's top 250, and did wonders for her confidence.\n\"I definitely put a lot of pressure on myself when I had my protected ranking,\" Robson told BBC Sport after qualifying for the main draw at the US Open.\n\"You know you are on a limited amount of time so I wasn't playing as freely as maybe I should have - especially at the Slams.\n\"But I knew I was putting in all the right things on the practice court and in the gym. It was waiting for that one moment where it all came together. I was prepared for it - I knew that I had this long season of training behind me.\"\nHer reward for overcoming a nasty bout of conjunctivitis to win three qualifying matches at Flushing Meadows is a first round match on Tuesday with fellow British player Naomi Broady.\nRobson is now being coached by the former British number one Lucie Ahl and Colin Beecher, and being watched here in New York by the LTA's lead women's coach Jeremy Bates.\n\"You see it a lot with athletes when they've had a long term injury,\" Bates explained, after Robson's early Saturday morning practice session.\n\"Mentally it's very difficult to fully commit yourself again to the physicality of the sport. At the back of your mind you're not quite sure if your body is going to break down or if it's properly healed.\n\"You can't shortcut it. At Wimbledon she was playing, but now when you see her play she's completely uninhibited, she's very mobile, she's chasing every ball. She's able to recover and compete as she used to. And you can see that she has no negative thoughts in her mind at all.\n\"It's completely mental - you've just got to get your brain around it.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nRobson has lost virtually three years of her career - but yet she is only 22, and is still armed with a devastating forehand. She says she is working harder than ever on the practice court, and has proved in the past she has the temperament for the big occasion.\nIn the first eight months of 2013 alone, Robson beat Petra Kvitova en route to the third round of the Australian Open; had clay court wins over Agnieszka Radwanska and Venus Williams; reached the fourth round of Wimbledon and then the third round of the US Open. As a result, she reached a career high ranking of 27.\nHer involvement in the final Grand Slam of this year has, though, come as a lovely surprise.\nAfter winning in Landisville, Robson's agent Max Eisenbud told her there was virtually no chance of her being awarded a wildcard into qualifying. Hence the flight back home to the UK, and then on to Italy for that girls' holiday.\nFind out how to get into tennis in our special guide.\nShe was soon gone. But not forgotten.\n\"I've had so many pictures of their sunset cruises and they have been tagging me in their Instagram as if I'm still part of the group,\" Robson said.\n\"We had squad necklaces and everything - it was a full on girls' trip.\n\"But they're very happy that I came here instead.\"", "prompt": "She found time to visit Mount Vesuvius and the ancient Roman city of Pompeii, she took her friends to the villa they had hired... and"}

The Chinese-owned firm aims to sell one million electric cars by 2025.\nMazda also plans to introduce electric technology in its cars from 2019.\nIn theory, a compression-ignition petrol engine should have big advantages.  But it isn't easy to make technology work - and some of the biggest companies, including General Motors, have already tried.\nSo why should a relatively small Japanese manufacturer like Mazda succeed? Well, partly because - unlike the really big players - it isn't afraid to take risks. It has done in the past.\nIt's the only mainstream manufacturer, for example, which has persisted with rotary engines in its cars. Like compression ignition motors, they have theoretical benefits, but create complex engineering challenges.\nMazda's rotary has had some success. The company won the Le Mans 24 Hours race with it in 1991, and the latest version was fitted in its RX-8 sportscar. Popular with drivers, it was sadly unreliable.\nIf the new motor is to be a success, it needs to be reliable as well as efficient. And Mazda needs to be able to persuade regulators that petrol engines still have a strong future.\nIt may prove to be the perfect stop-gap, as electric cars are developed and charging infrastructure is created.\nOr it may turn out to be a brilliant idea, which has come to fruition just a few years too late.", "prompt": "It said the compression ignition engine was up to 30% more fuel-efficient than its current engines.\nIt plans to sell cars with the new engine from"}

Next year, landlords are likely to be hit again when their right to deduct their mortgage interest from their income tax bill is removed.\nRics suggests that the stamp duty increase should be reversed, a move which would infuriate potential first-time buyers - many of whom say they are regularly outbid by buy-to-let investors.\nGeneration Rent, a group that campaigns for better conditions for tenants, said the higher rate of stamp duty was a good thing.\n\"It does give first-time buyers a much-needed advantage against people who are simply betting that house prices will keep going up,\" said Dan Wilson Craw, the policy manager of Generation Rent.\n\"In the first three months of the surcharge, the tax on second homes raised £424m - that cash could help build new homes for people on low incomes.\"\nA body that represents landlords said that rents were likely to rise.\n\"Tenants will be hurt most, as landlords recover the stamp duty increase by charging tenants more,\" said David Cox, the managing director of the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA).\n\"The simple answer is that we need to build more homes.\"\nIn addition to a reversal in the stamp duty increase, Rics also called for:\nRics' call comes just a day after Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the government would take \"unprecedented steps\" to encourage construction of homes for people to buy.\nHe told the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham that the housing shortage was \"a huge issue for our country\" and would be his \"number-one priority\".\nHe said: \"Far too many young people cannot get a foot on the housing ladder.

It is also used to treat metabolic syndrome, a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.\nPrevious work has shown that metformin can extend the lifespan of simple organisms such as worms, but studies in flies and mammals have given conflicting evidence.\nThe scientists gave one of two different doses of metformin to middle-aged male mice and found that lower doses increased lifespan by about 5%, and also delayed the onset of age-associated diseases. But they said the higher dose of metformin was toxic and reduced the lifespan of mice.\nFurther studies were needed to determine if metformin has any effect on human health and lifespan, said Dr de Cabo.\n\"These are very promising results that need to be translated to humans via clinical studies,\" he said.\nHe said the best current advice was to eat a good diet and exercise.\n\"Right now the best that we can say is probably what your grandmother told you,\" he told BBC News.\n\"Eat a good diet and exercise are the only two things that we know for sure that they work very well in humans.\"\nProf Tom Kirkwood, associate dean for ageing at Newcastle University, said it is unclear what the study might mean for human health.\n\"Metformin is a well-established drug that acts on metabolism and has long been used against type-2 diabetes,\" he said.\n\"We've known for a long time that modulating metabolism in mice can extend survival and postpone age-related conditions, and there are sound reasons why this should be the case is a small, short-lived animal.\n\"What we don't know however is whether similar effects on lifespan might be produced in humans.\n\"This is something that we cannot simply take for granted and the study's authors do well to sound a note of caution.\"", "prompt": "Scientists believe the drug, metformin, may mimic the effects of extreme calorie restriction.\nThis regime, which is based on eating a very low calorie"}

Since we knew the Burmese language it was easy for us to start businesses,\" Mr Sarlan recalls.\nSoon, the Tamils in Moreh invited their relatives and friends from camps in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere to join them.\nMany went on to become Indian citizens.\nBy the 1990s the number of Burmese Tamils in Moreh had increased to about 15,000, almost half of the town's population. They had set up their own schools, temples, churches and mosques - and celebrated their cultural festivals with fervour. Moreh was described as a \"mini-India\".\n\"We still retain lots of cultural and social links with Tamil Nadu state. For our important temple festivals we bring priests and music performers from there. Many parents in Moreh also send their children to schools in Tamil Nadu,\" says K Balasubramaniam, who is the principal of a local secondary school.\nChinese goods\nAt one point, Burmese Tamils dominated local border trade and that led to resentment from the Kuki community and others.\nSeveral people were killed in bloody clashes between Tamils and Kukis in 1995, but relations have improved since then.\n\"We take part in each other's cultural and religious festivals. We have several committees to look into any problems and they get sorted out immediately,\" says Manohar Mohan, a Tamil businessman.\nTamil businesses suffered a setback after the Burmese government established a market just inside their border in Namphalong in the mid-1990s. Chinese products flooded in and many Burmese started shopping in Namphalong rather than Moreh.\nTraders in Manipur also faced threats from insurgents in the state - some of the businessmen who refused to pay \"extortion money\" were shot dead.\nThe violence and lack of business opportunities forced many traders and Burmese Indians to leave Moreh, many opting for Chennai. Now Moreh's Tamil population is just 3,500.\n'Gateway'\nThe insurgency has been contained to a large extent in the last few years. Many traders in Moreh hope the town will regain its business importance once the long-pending Asian Highway, linking the state capital Imphal with Yangon and Bangkok materialises.\nMoreh is considered to be India's gateway to South East Asia and locals believe because of its unique geography the place offers tremendous potential.\nThe story of the town's Burmese Tamils is one of suffering and resilience as well as achievement.\nMany elderly Tamils, originally from Burma, are nostalgic and want to stay in Moreh, as it is closer to where they come from.  But later generations say the town offers little in terms of education and employment.\n\"If we don't have the right education facilities then we have to go elsewhere. We can't do higher studies here. Also, girls can get only teaching jobs here in Moreh. So there are no other options but to leave this town and go to a place like Chennai,\" says B Revathy, a university student.\nEmotional attachment it seems may not be enough for Moreh to keep its Burmese Tamils.", "prompt": "He is among thousands of Burmese Tamils living in the north-eastern Indian town of Moreh in Manipur state, which borders Myanmar,"}

Meanwhile, weekend mornings were spent researching possible locations to open a gym.\nWithin a month the duo had hatched their plan to create a new type of female-friendly gym called Frame.\nThe aim was to run energetic and feel-good classes covering everything from dance to \"rocket yoga\", and \"dynamic Pilates\".\nTheir ambition was to radicalise the fitness market, which they felt was staid due to a lack of innovation.\nCrux to the strategy was introducing a pay-as-you-go model, giving their customers the flexibility to drop in on classes, such dance sessions as \"Frame Rave\", \"Music Video\" and \"80s Aerobics\", without having any commitment to go to more.\nArmed with a bank loan, the pair quit their jobs and launched Frame's first gym, or as they call it, \"fitness studio\", in Shoreditch, east London, in 2009.\n\"It was all a bit of a whirlwind,\" recalls Ms Black, 33, a former England hockey player.\n\"We just clicked. Joan had just returned back from New Zealand [her home country], and had looked at what was happening in the fitness industry there\n\"And in true Joan style she sucked me in and decided to tell me what we were going to do, which is quite useful in a business partner. I quite like that.\"\nMs Murphy, 35, says Frame was unique when it started out.\n\"We were the first multi-disciplined pay-as you-go studio,\" she says.\n\"If you wanted to go to Pilates [at a studio] you had to pay up front for 10 classes. There was no fitness pay-as-you-go.\n\"If you didn't want to buy gym membership because you only wanted to go once or twice a week there was nothing. We wanted to put all the disciplines under one roof and make it accessible.\"\nHowever, before their venture even got off the ground, Frame faced a major setback.\nDays before their Shoreditch venue was set to open, a road closure meant there was no access to the gym.\n\"There was no through road,\" says Ms Black. \"So we had to wait six months before opening. We had handed out flyers, recruited teachers.\"\nWith the postponement of the fitness studio and bills mounting, they both took temporary jobs - Ms Murphy as a carer for the elderly, and Ms Black looking after children.\nWhen Frame was eventually up and running, both got stuck into the day-to-day operations, each clocking up 30 hours a week either on reception, or as an instructor, on top of running the business.\n\"We were a proper start-up,\" says Ms Murphy.  \"But it wasn't just about starting a fitness business, it was what we wanted to do.\"\nThanks to positive word of mouth, and some advertising, Frame's customer numbers quickly grew.\nFurther helped by the continuing growth of the UK health and fitness market, which according to industry figures is now worth Â£4.3bn per year, Frame has since taken out additional bank loans to open two further London outposts in Queen's Park and King's Cross.\nThe expanding empire has swelled Frame's turnover to Â£2.8m in 2015, up from Â£2.1m on the previous year.\nOpening more gyms is now firmly on the agenda for the two ambitious women, who in December received funding from angel investors.\n\"We're keen to cut our teeth outside of London, and our growth plans in the long term are quite big,\" says Ms Black.\nThe goal is to open two new gyms per year, and mooted first locations include Brighton, Bristol and Manchester. They also currently have a month-long pop-up gym near Old Street tube station, in east London.\nFrame has also tapped into other revenue streams, such as having cafes at its venues. There has also been a move into clothing, with a second sportswear collaboration with High Street fashion chain Whistles set to launch in May.\nAnd while women remain the main focus, men can join Frame, and in fact now make up 20% of customers.\nPaul Davis, a senior leisure and technology analyst at market research group Mintel, says Frame's success is down to two main reasons - its upmarket offering, and its range of classes.\n\"Whilst the vast majority of growth in the health and fitness club market can be attributed to the growth of the \"no-frills\" budget gym sector - city-based fitness boutiques such as Frame look to deliver an elite experience at the other end of the scale,\" he says.\n\"By focusing on areas outside of traditional gym activities such as dance classes and post-natal Pilates the studio appeals to a predominantly female demographic, who may not otherwise show an interest in joining a typical fitness club.\"\nBut why the name Frame?

He was the youngest child of brewer John Swanson and his wife Mary.\nThe distillery, which closed in 1851, is now long gone and ruined buildings now mark the spot.\nMr Swanson was still a boy when his family left Geise and moved to a home in Thurso's Durness Street.\nHe attended Robert Meikle's Parish School in Thurso's Market Place, before going to the Miller Institution.\nAfter leaving school, Mr Swanson was a teacher for a time at the Miller Institution, which is today a public library.\nIn 1867, Mr Swanson left on a horse-drawn stagecoach with the aim of getting himself to London.\nHis 83-year-old granddaughter Mary Berkin said: \"When you are 20 the world is your oyster and I suppose he thought 'if I get on that stagecoach I will get to London eventually and make my fortune'.\"\nIn 1868, the young man joined the Metropolitan Police.\nMr Swanson rose through the ranks and earned promotions to sergeant, detective inspector and detective chief inspector in 1888 - the year of Jack the Ripper's murder of five women in the Whitechapel area.\nIn 1896 he was made superintendent of the force's criminal investigation department.\nDuring his long career in the police, Mr Swanson handled investigations into some of the worst crimes of the Victorian age.\nHe was involved in the arrest of murderer Percy Lefroy Mapleton in 1881.\nMapleton planned a robbery on a train from London to Brighton. He targeted a former stockbroker, killing the man by throwing him out of a carriage after unsuccessfully shooting at him with a revolver.\nMr Swanson was involved in two other major investigations that same year.\nOne led to the recovery of jewellery worth Â£250,000 stolen from a Lady Alice Bective.\nLater, Mr Swanson found himself back in Scotland tasked with hunting down a gang of grave robbers who stole the body of an aristocrat and demanded a ransom for its return.\nA stone cross still marks the spot where the Earl of Crawford's body was found unceremoniously buried in woods near Dunecht in Aberdeenshire.\nIn 1884, the detective helped in the hunt for those responsible for a prolonged bombing campaign, and four years later tackled his most gruesome case.\nJack the Ripper murdered five women in the Whitechapel area of London.\nIn private notes, Mr Swanson named \"Kosminski\" as the killer.\nIn more modern times, writers have named Polish-born Aaron Kosminski as a suspect.\nMr Kosminski, a hairdresser who arrived in England in 1882, had a history of mental illness.\nHe was allegedly spotted at the scene of the murder of Elizabeth Stride, believed to be the Ripper's third victim.\nMr Wood said: \"According to Swanson's annotations, Kosminski was a prime suspect.\n\"He went insane and was committed to an asylum where he died shortly afterwards.\"\nIn 1903, the Scottish detective, who frequently returned to Thurso for holidays, retired on a pension of Â£280-a-year.\nHe died in Surrey on 24 November 1924 and was buried at Kingston cemetery.\nMr Swanson's police rattle was brought to the unveiling ceremony in Thurso by his family.\nRattles were carried by Metropolitan Police officers until the 1880s as a means of raising an alarm.

{"human": "But the inspiration for this scheme to improve health services in Zambia began in very low-tech and unhappy circumstances.\nHuw Jones, working in Zambia as a safari guide, was driving a Land Rover along a road in a remote part of the country.\nHe saw a trail of blood in the road, and his first reaction was that it might have come from an animal killed by a lion.\nBut he came across a couple on a bike - the man riding and the woman carried on the handlebars.\nShe was pregnant and bleeding heavily and they had been cycling for hours with the aim of reaching the nearest hospital, almost 60 miles away.\nThe woman was in a great deal of pain and her husband seemed to be in a state of shock, says Mr Jones.\n\"In the heat and that terrain, they were desperate,\" he says.\nMr Jones stopped to pick them up and drive them.\nBut the woman was already weak and died in the back of the Land Rover before they could reach anyone who could give them medical help.\n\"It affected me quite deeply. I wondered if I could do anything,\" says Mr Jones.\nIt was an awful example of the lack of medical provision for rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa - and, he says, he has come across too many deaths that could have been avoided with better care.\nZambia has about 1,600 doctors for a population of 14 million, and two-thirds of these are working in towns and cities, while most of the country's population is in the countryside.\nIt means access to good quality health care is often difficult if not impossible.\nWhen Mr Jones returned to the UK, he began to develop a project to fill some of these gaps.\nHe set up the Virtual Doctors charity, based in Brighton, which uses the expertise of volunteer doctors in the UK to provide direct and individual support for health workers in Zambia.\nFor many communities, it is not practical to expect sick and frail people to walk or cycle for hours to hospital.\nSo families depend on rural health centres, which have health workers but no qualified doctors.\nThe virtual doctors project means that these isolated health centres can be supported by doctors thousands of miles away.\nHealth workers and clinical officers on the ground use an app on a smartphone or tablet computer to take notes on a patient's symptoms and photographs.\nThis information is sent to a volunteer doctor in the UK who helps with a diagnosis and recommends treatment.\nMore stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective and how to get in touch\nCases are directed towards doctors with a relevant specialism, whether it is skin diseases or HIV and Aids-related problems.\nThe doctor in the UK will have a list of the drugs and equipment kept in the health centre in Zambia and can suggest treatment or further tests based on what is practical and available.\n\"For instance, there's no point calling for an MRI scan,\" says Mr Jones.\nVirtual Doctors is now supporting 19 rural health centres, which typically deal with problems such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/Aids and pregnancy-related conditions.\nThere are also two district hospitals taking part in the project.\nMr Jones says that even where there are facilities such as X-ray machines, there can be a shortage of radiologists to look at the evidence.\nThe virtual doctors in the UK have been able to help with chest X-rays of patients in Zambia, he says.\nThese local health centres have catchment areas of tens of thousands of people, and hospitals provide services for hundreds of thousands. And Mr Jones says the virtual doctors are now supporting health services for almost a million people.\nThe charity wants to expand further, with discussions in progress about working with other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Tanzania and Uganda.\nMobile-phone networks are improving, and that could mean moving to more direct, real-time ways of communicating, such as video conferencing.\nBut Mr Jones says the emphasis must be on a system that is robust, simple, reliable and can be depended upon to work.\nThe app used to connect the virtual doctors was itself made by volunteer coders and developers from the Landmark Information Group in Exeter, working in their spare time.\nFormer Education Secretary Charles Clarke, who is supporting the project, describes it as a \"brilliant initiative that brings together voluntary expertise and desperate need\".\nThe Virtual Doctor system has been backed by the Zambian government.\nMuyeba Chikonde, Zambia's high commissioner in the UK, said he was very pleased at the assistance being provided.\nHe said it was in the spirit of \"ubuntu\" - a word used in southern Africa to suggest a philosophy of sharing and showing \"humanity towards others\".", "prompt": "But the inspiration for this scheme to improve health services in Zambia began in very low-tech and unhappy circumstances.\nHuw Jones, working in Zambia as a"}

You have got to do what you have to do.\"\nWith BrewDog now being able to increase its brewing facilities, it was able to start supplying Tesco on time with bottles of its Punk IPA.\nThe beer was an immediate hit, and the other UK supermarkets soon followed suit.\nFast forward to 2014, and BrewDog is due to see its turnover top £32m this year.\nIt employs 357 people, and as well as continuing to supply the likes of Tesco UK-wide, it owns 25 bars, 18 across the UK, and seven abroad.\nAnd now based at a larger brewery down the road in the town of Ellon, it exports to 52 countries.\nChildhood friends who grew up in the Scottish town of Peterhead, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie started brewing beer together as a hobby in their early 20s.\nAt the time Mr Watt was working as a deep sea fisherman, while Mr Dickie was a whisky distiller.\nFrom the very start they were inspired to brew American-style craft beers - sweet-tasting ales with high alcohol levels and very large amounts of US hops, which gave them a bold, fruity, even perfumed flavour.\nThey are very Marmite beers in that you either love them or hate them. To fans they are flavoursome and interesting, to critics they are undrinkable.\nYet, confident they could convert drinkers, and after some good reviews, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie decided to quit their day jobs and start brewing professionally in 2007.\n\"Even though the first year was tough, we never lost faith in what we were doing,\" says Mr Watt. \"We were hell-bent... we were stupidly ambitious.\"\nIn addition to the bold flavours, the two men also worked hard on creating an irreverent brand image for BrewDog, giving their beers fun names, and bright, colourful labels. Some of their other brews are called Dead Pony Pale Ale, Dogma and Hardcore IPA.\nExpansion has been made possible after the business raised £7m via crowdfunding, with 15,000 people paying £95 for a stake in the company. In return they get discounts in BrewDog's bars, and other perks.\nIn more controversial matters, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie have also regularly - and enthusiastically - attacked regulators and industry bodies. Their critics say they do so simply to garner publicity, but Mr Watt says they are merely sticking up for themselves.\nEarlier this year the Portman Group, the UK drinks industry trade body that promotes responsible drinking, criticised BrewDog, saying that the label of the brewery's Dead Pony Pale Ale promoted anti-social behaviour and binge drinking.\nBrewDog's response at the time was as follows: \"Unfortunately, the Portman Group is a gloomy gaggle of killjoy jobsworths, funded by navel-gazing international drinks giants.\"\nWhen contacted by the BBC for this article, a spokesman for the Portman Group said: \"BrewDog's business model has traditionally used complaints by the public as a PR opportunity for their brands.\n\"BrewDog and the Portman Group have a long history... we don't expect them to like us, but we were pleased to see they have started relabeling their products.\"\nThere are no hard and fast rules on what makes a \"craft beer\". However, typically it is a natural beer made by a small brewery, often with large amounts of pungent hops and a marked sweetness from the barley malt\nSo what is the difference between \"craft beer\" and \"real ale\"? Unlike craft beer, real ale - as determined by UK pressure group Campaign For Real Ale - has to be unpasteurised and unfiltered. Real ale also more often has a drier flavour.\nCraft beer is also typically served well chilled and carbonated, whereas real ales are served less cold and have no added gas\nYet, like lager (which itself can be a craft beer or real ale), they share the same basic four ingredients - malted barley, hops, yeast and water. In all cases other ingredients can be added on top, such as different grains\nA similar dispute that BrewDog had in 2013 with the UK's advertising watchdog, the ASA, saw Mr Watt call the officials \"killjoy, self-important pen pushers\".\nBrewDog has also been criticised for selling some beers with exceptionally high alcohol rates, such as a limited edition ale that was 55% alcohol.\nMr Watt says that he and Mr Dickie - who together own a 75% share of the business - remain unrepentant, and simply \"make beers that we want to drink ourselves\".\nMr Watt adds that BrewDog's products are bought by beer aficionados, and priced at a premium. He says that if someone is going to abuse alcohol they will be the cheaper, mass market beers that give drinkers \"maximum bang for their buck\".\nWith exports now making up 65% of sales, Mr Watt says they have no plans to slow down the fast-paced growth.\n\"My worry is that we aren't growing fast enough,\" he says.", "prompt": "It was back in 2008, and James Watt and Martin Dickie's then tiny brewery at Fraserburgh, north-east Scotland, was little over"}
{"human": "In December, the government announced finalised plans for a cull, initially in pilot areas, as a way to curb the spread of tuberculosis in cattle.\nIn applying for judicial review, the Badger Trust says culling will not stop TB and may in fact help spread it.\nOther campaign groups are considering action under the Bern Convention, which protects European wildlife.\nThe government's plans are likely to result in farmers funding contractors to shoot badgers in a number of areas of England, with two initial pilots in west Gloucestershire and west Somerset taking place later this year.\n\"We have identified some serious flaws in the way by which the Secretary of State [Caroline Spelman] reached her decision to cull badgers,\" said Gwendolen Morgan of Bindmans solicitors, lawyer for the Badger Trust.\n\"Given that Defra's proposals come at an enormous cost to farmers, and threaten to prompt rather than prevent the spread of disease, we hope that this ill-conceived decision will be struck down by the court.\"\nShe pointed to government projections that culling would reduce TB incidence by 12-16% over nine years.\nTheProtection of Badgers Actsays licences to kill can be granted for \"preventing the spread of disease\" - and the trust argues that the slow-down in the rate of increase, or \"reduction in new incidence\", projected by Defra does not qualify as \"prevention\".\nThe government's plan involves having Natural England issue culling licences. The Badger Trust says the guidance given to Natural England is unlawful.\nPotentially the most important element of its case concerns the methods used to kill badgers.\nIn the landmark UK study, the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), badgers were trapped before being shot.\nHowever, the government plans to allow licensed contractors to shoot badgers as they roam - \"free shooting\" - which is likely to be less efficient and to increase disruption of badger families.\nThe RBCT showed that when badger's social groups are disrupted, they roam further, carrying the TB bacterium to more farms.\nFor this reason, the trust argues that after the pilots, farmers may be forced to resort to trap-and-shoot, because free shooting will either prove ineffective or a hazard to public safety.\nThat would escalate the cost by anything up to a factor of 10 - and the Badger Trust says this possibility damages the government's economic case for a cull.\nAs the majority of new cases arise through infection from other cattle rather than from badgers, the trust says the government should simply invest in stricter cattle control measures.\nRegulations on farmers were recently tightened and testing regimes intensified - but the National Farmers' Union, the government and other proponents believe culling is needed in badly affected areas in addition to existing measures.\nIn 2010, 25,000 cattle were slaughtered as a result of TB infection, and the disease is costing the UK taxpayer in the region of Â£100m per year.\nThey also argue that culling would in the end benefit badgers, as TB infection is seriously debilitating to them.\n\"Nobody wants to see badgers culled, but no country in the world where wildlife carries TB has successfully controlled the disease in cattle without tackling its presence in wildlife as well,\" said a Defra spokeswoman.\n\"Unless further action is taken now, it will continue to get worse.\"\nBadgers are protected under UK law, and also under the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats.\nCampaigners are also considering using this as another weapon to use in the long-running battle over culling.\nLast year, wildlife groups began programmes of vaccination, and some animal groups believe this will in the end remove any need for culling.\nThe Welsh Assembly Government is due to announce its decision on a proposed pilot cull in West Wales early this year.\nFollow Richardon Twitter", "prompt": "In December, the government announced finalised plans for a cull, initially in pilot areas, as a way to curb the spread of tuberculosis in cattle"}

{"human": "\"We are about a third of the way down the road,\" she says.\nHaving been one the major players behind Manchester's recent cultural renaissance, she takes on the leadership of the Tate with palpable energy and ambition.\nHer intention, she says, is to change the Tate in the next 20 years as much as her predecessor - Sir Nicholas Serota - changed it in the last two decades.\nGiven that he oversaw the transformation of the museum from a respected gallery in Pimlico (with a regional outlet in Liverpool) into a global mega art brand, it is a bold claim.\nSir Nicholas built his Tate empire with bricks and mortar, refurbishing existing galleries and creating new venues such as Tate Modern. Balshaw will take a different approach with her expansionist agenda, focussing more on people rather than real estate.\nRoughly speaking, according to statistics collected by the newly-renamed Department of Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, around 50% of the British population visit a museum or gallery at least once a year, meaning - of course - 50% do not. These absentees are her target audience.\nShe says: \"We should absolutely reasonably expect 75% of the population to love the fact we have a national collection and feel happy to be visiting Tateâ€¦ and every young person should be given the opportunity to think and play and experiment in the spaces Tate holds. And that is a big, big shift.\"\nHer clarity of vision is impressive, but her ability to explain how it will be realised is less exact. She wants to usher in \"an easier language to talk about the joy of art\" but couldn't be specific beyond saying that arcane words should be either avoided or explained.\nShe talks of a radical transformation in audience profile, of a lack of representation of people from BAME background among the staff and in the sector more generally. But when it comes to the organisation she is now leading, which is to be the agent for the change she desires, she says, \"it's not that we need to change anything particularly\".\nThere is no doubt she is sincere in her ambitions, and probably more capable than most in the museum and gallery world when it comes to broadening the audience.\nBut if she is to be successful in her aims she will need to take a leaf out of Sir Nicholas's job application for the Tate director's job back in the 1980s - in which he wrote that for the institution to change he would need to grasp the nettle.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

{"human": "The Miscarriage Association, which came up with the figure, wants people to open up about baby loss to break what it calls \"the last taboo\".\nOne mother has gone a step further and filmed the aftermath of her miscarriage for a documentary, to challenge the secrecy surrounding it.\nLisa Francesca Nand, from Greenwich, has suffered five miscarriages in total, including one the day before her 12-week scan.\n\"One minute I was pregnant, we were planning the future and thinking about being a mummy and daddy. Then suddenly, in the space of a few hours, we were no longer going to be parents, it was heartbreaking,\" she says.\nThe experience made her determined to share her story. One scene shows her husband David waiting outside the hospital while she has the remains of their second unborn child removed from her body.\n\"They had sent me home to pass the sac. It took a week of walking around with a dead baby inside me for it to come out. And I bled for six weeks afterwards. No-one talks about the physical pain, so I didn't expect it.\n\"I started filming a video diary because no-one talks about it. I want people to understand they are not alone, \" adds Lisa, who has since gone on to have two healthy boys.\nSo why are miscarriages still shrouded in mystery? Ruth Bender Atik, national director of the Miscarriage Association, thinks it is because of the \"rule\" that women should not announce their pregnancy before their first scan.\n\"Most miscarriages happen in the first three months. If you don't tell people you are pregnant then sadly you are not going to get the support that you need when you are grieving. It doesn't suit everyone to talk about their pregnancy before their scan, but it can help.\n\"We don't tell people 'in case something happens', but that can reinforce the idea that you should keep it a secret if you miscarry,\" Ms Bender Atik said.\nThe reason behind a miscarriage is often unclear - leaving women with no one to blame but themselves, she adds.\n\"Most women never find out why, so they think it must be their fault, and this is very a dangerous path to go down.\"\nFamily and friends might not know how to react, and can make things worse with insensitive comments, according to Ms Bender Atik.\n\"We want people to say things like 'I am so sorry for your loss' and 'do you want to talk about it?', rather than 'don't worry, you will be pregnant again soon,\" she added.\nMy own miscarriage happened earlier this year, at nine weeks in to my first pregnancy. I noticed some light bleeding and was sent to Colchester Hospital for a scan.\nMy husband and I were overjoyed to catch the first glimpse of our tiny baby, with a strong heartbeat pulsing furiously away on the screen.\nOnly a few friends and family members knew that I was pregnant, and we rushed round to show them the photos of our beautiful baby.\nBut 24 hours later we were sat in the same chair, being told that our precious baby had gone.\nSitting in the car park crying, we tried to make sense of what had happened. My husband told me through tears that all he had ever wanted was to be a father, and I felt like I had let him down.\nWe had planned to tell his parents that evening over dinner, so we still made the trip up north and kept our restaurant reservation.\nWe sat in shocked silence for most of the journey, playing songs that I have not been able to listen to since.\nTelling them we had miscarried felt even harder, because they had never known the joy of my pregnancy in the first place.\nIn the following days, I began to blame myself. It must have been the heavy camera kit I had stupidly picked up at work. Or perhaps it was the rum I drank on an all-inclusive holiday before I knew I was pregnant.\nMy husband was hugely supportive throughout, but I found myself pushing him away, telling him that he did not understand how it felt.\nI made him put the baby books and maternity clothes I had foolishly bought in the loft, because it was too painful to look at them. How naÃ¯ve I was to buy them, I berated myself, looking at the nursing chair in the corner that I knew I would not sit in.\nI talked about getting a tattoo because I felt like I had nothing to show for being pregnant, as if it had never really happened at all.\nOne of my best friends told me she was pregnant and was due at the same time as I would have been, and I hated myself for not feeling happy for her.\n\"I'm really lucky that I didn't need to have an operation, some people have much worse miscarriages,\" I kept telling friends and family, to make them feel better. But inside I felt like the unluckiest person in the world.\nI went straight back to work because my colleagues did not know, and on the first day I had to attend an inquest about a dead baby. But this is completely normal, I told myself. After all, no-one talks about miscarriage.\nSix months on, I have realised three things. Firstly that men can suffer as much as women after a miscarriage, and if anything, this experience has made our marriage stronger.\nSecondly and probably most importantly, that it was not my fault. And thirdly, that miscarriage is so much more common than I had realised.\nI slowly started telling people and was amazed by how many confided that they too had secretly suffered this fate.\nI posted a message on Facebook saying I was writing this article and friends I had known for years got in touch, having never before shared their stories of loss.\nOne said she had a miscarriage at work but felt like she had to hide because she did not want to tell her boss.\nNot a day goes by without another of my friends thinking about her babies and what they would have become.\nOne friend sent me a note to say she was going through her second miscarriage at this very moment.\nAnother said she could not tell anyone because she felt ashamed, like she had failed at the one thing women should be able to do.\nNo-one should feel like this after a miscarriage.

{"human": "Heydrich - one of the architects of the Final Solution when he was governor of occupied Bohemia - was assassinated by British-trained Czech and Slovak troops in May 1942.\nIt was an operation which was so audacious in its planning and execution that it inspired John Martin from Mold, Flintshire, to research the topic for more than 40 years.\nHe interviewed Heydrich's son, and descendants of the Special Operations Executive hit-team which killed him, as part of a book which has now been made into a film.\nAnthropoid, named after the mission's codename, has just gone on general release.\nIt stars actors Cillian Murphy and Fifty Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan who portrays a Czech resistance fighter.\nMr Martin, who is an extra in the film, said: \"Not many people have heard of Anthropoid, partly because it was earlier on in the war, and partly because afterwards Britain's role was played down by the Soviets.\n\"It took me until after the fall of the Iron Curtain to be able to get into Prague and properly investigate what happened.\"\nBorn in 1904, Reinhard Heydrich was a decorated German naval officer in the Weimar Republic.\nDuring the rise of the Nazis he progressed quickly to head several branches of the Nazi secret police, including the Gestapo and SD, and was a key figure in both 'The Night of The Long Knives' and 'Kristallnacht'.\nAs Nazi head in occupied Czechoslovakia, he was instructed to improve the productivity of the region's flagging munitions and automobile factories.\nIt was a role which he performed so successfully that the Allies determined he must be removed.\nMr Martin said: \"Before Heydrich's appointment the Czech Resistance had been quite successful in reducing productivity by as much as a third through go-slows.\n\"Heydrich introduced a policy he called 'Sugar and Whip', whereby those who cooperated gained extra rations and clothing, whilst those who didn't were kidnapped, tortured and killed.\n\"In one way the fact he rewarded people might be seen as a humanising feature, but I think it makes him all the more chilling.\n\"For him, it wasn't about the violence, he'd do whatever it took to achieve the Nazis' ultimate ambitions.\"\nIn December 1941 the SOE assassination squad of Josef Gabcik and Jan Kubis was parachuted into Bohemia from an RAF Halifax bomber.\nThey spent six months undercover planning their assault, before finally ambushing Heydrich on a blind hairpin bend on the Prague to Dresden road on 27 May 1942.\nHeydrich died of his injuries a week later, and although the Nazis reaped devastating revenge, Mr Martin contends it was still a worthwhile mission.\nMr Martin said: \"Hitler personally ordered the levelling of two villages - Lidice and LeÅ¾Ã¡ky - where all the men over 16 were shot and all the women transported to concentration camps.\n\"The ordinary population paid a terrible price for what was essentially an economic and military attack. Yet you can see in Hitler's response just what a devastating blow the assassination was.\n\"Hitler was furious at the arrogance which led Heydrich to travel in an unguarded open top car, and later he'd say that the loss of Heydrich was the beginning of the end in the battle for the Eastern Front.\"\nMr Martin currently works on cruise ships, where he gives both comedy performances and history lectures on Heydrich.\n\"It's a strange life for me,\" he said. \"One night I'll be telling jokes, and the next afternoon I'm lecturing on the holocaust.\n\"Some comedians can make jokes about things like that, but I have to keep the two completely separate.\n\"I'm delighted that my book's been made into a film.

{"human": "Former Manchester United player and coach Phil Neville explains what Louis van Gaal has learned from his first season in the Premier League and why his team are not far away from being title contenders again.\nThis season, they have dropped points in 10 out of their 16 away games against teams below them in the table. They got rolled over at Everton and Leicester, and drew with Burnley, Sunderland and West Brom.\nIn the past, the aim at United was always to do the double over everybody outside the top six.\nWe approached all of those games - home or away - with the aim of winning them and doing that was one of our strengths down the years.\nThat meant, when we came up against our rivals in the top five, our record against the rest meant that those big games were not must-win and the pressure was off us a bit.\nThis season, it has largely been the opposite. United have produced their best football against the other teams in the top five and have struggled against the sides that have camped in their own half and made things difficult for them.\nGoing forward, United need a player who can make the difference in those games, when the opposition are packing their defence.\nChelsea have that with Eden Hazard. Last season, Luis Suarez did it for Liverpool. Those players can win you the title because, when games are tight, they make the difference.\nBut at the moment United do not have anyone who is providing those bits of individual brilliance in the final third.\nA lot of people are saying Gareth Bale would be the answer to that particular problem but I think United already have the right player on their books - if he performs to his capabilities.\nAngel Di Maria arrived for a British record fee last summer but, considering his £59.7m price-tag and his reputation, he has not delivered since his first three or four games.\nEven so, he is still the United player who excites me the most.\nEverything about the way he plays from his pace, his skill, and his ability running or passing forwards tells me he has what it takes to shine at Old Trafford. He has just not done it yet.\nNext season could be the time when he realises what it takes.\nHe now knows there are no easy games in the Premier League, and that he has to toughen himself up.\nDi Maria will also understand that United are a huge club. He is on a big stage and there is a bit of pressure on him.\nWe know he can do much better, and so will he.\nI would love to see him play to his potential because he could be the attacking star this United team needs to make the next step.\nVan Gaal's first season as United manager is also almost over and he will have found out a lot about English football over the last few months.\nEarlier in the campaign, he tried playing three at the back and I don't think that system worked for United.\nVan Gaal probably tried it because he was trying to accommodate Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata in the same team, but he has realised that he can't do that in the Premier League.\nWhen he arrived at Old Trafford, I think he might have under-estimated that anyone can beat anyone in this country.\nMaybe in some of the countries where he has managed in the past, teams in the bottom half of the table do not even give you a contest. Here, they do.\nAt times Van Gaal has probably been surprised by the intensity of every game that United have played, but he will have learned from it too.\nNext season, he will come back and be thinking 'I know what I need to do'.\nVan Gaal has achieved his aim for his first year at United by securing a top-four finish and a return to the Champions League. Because of that, it has been a good season for him.\nNow his next target is to win the title, and I don't think United are far away from being champions again.\nThe important thing is that they are going in the right direction. To go from seventh, where they finished last season, to first was always going to be impossible.\nPeople might say that is defeatist and not the way United should think but you cannot make that leap, even by spending £150m like United did last summer.\nYou have to do it gradually. Going from seventh to fourth then first is achievable, although it clearly will not be easy.\nCan they do it? If David De Gea leaves, then that would be a big blow. Without him in goal, I don't think they would have finished in the top four this time.\nI am worried he will go because he has not signed a new contract and the noises coming out of the club about his future are not good, particularly if Real Madrid do come calling.\nAlong with Marouane Fellaini, Ashley Young and Juan Mata, De Gea's individual form has been one of the high points of the season.\nBut it was United's sensational team performance in their win over Liverpool in March that was the most encouraging thing for the future.\nFor me, it was their performance of the season and the one that gives me massive hope for what they can achieve next season.\nIn fact, that period in March and April where they also beat Tottenham and Manchester City gave us a glimpse of what this team can do.\nThat is the level that they have to play at consistently to challenge for the title.\nThey could not do it this time but, just as with Van Gaal, a lot of United players will be better for what has happened to them in the last few months. I am expecting further improvement from them too.\nPhil Neville was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "prompt": "Former Manchester United player and coach Phil Neville explains what Louis van Gaal has learned from his first season in the Premier League and why his team are not"}

Therefore, it was important that schools did not overlook the opportunities that outdoor learning provided to bridge this gap.\n\"At the moment, if outdoor learning is part of a school's curriculum in England, it is largely because the teachers recognise the value of it,\" said report co-author, Sue Waite, a reader in outdoor learning at Plymouth University, UK.\n\"With so much focus on academic attainment, there can be pressure on teachers to stay in the classroom which means children are missing out on so many experiences that will benefit them through their lives.\"\nMs Waite added that the report showed that although there was a significant body of research that supports outdoor learning in both formal and informal contexts, it was likely to remain on the margins of education until the benefits were recognised by policymakers and reflected in policies. The report calls for it to be adopted by national curricula.\nThe report made a number of recommendations, including the establishment of a \"strategic policy/research hub\" to \"collate existing research, prioritise future research needs and help improve the alignment between research and policy\".\nThe report also proposed a \"Framework for 21st Century Student Outcomes\" that could be delivered through regular lessons in natural environments.\nThe outcomes were grouped into five themes:\n\"We need to be a little bit clearer about what forms of outdoor learning meet what purposes and aims (of curricula),\" Ms Waite told BBC News.\n\"So rather than just being outdoors magically making things happen, activities such as residential outdoor experiences would be particularly effective for developing social skills and leadership,\" she said.\n\"Whereas field studies would be particularly effective for greater awareness of the environment.\n\"What we argue in the report is for people to think about the purpose and place (of the activity), as well as the people involved, in order to construct different forms of outdoor learning that will meet certain (teaching) aims.\"\nMs Waite said that the findings acknowledged that schools were under pressure to deliver results, and found increasing constraints on time, finance and other resources.\nShe said that linking outdoor activities to learning outcomes would allow it to become part of a curriculum so there would be \"no need to find extra time\" for outdoor learning.\nShe added: \"Getting it embedded within policy gives that extra reassurance to teachers that this is something justifiable to do.\"\nMs Waite's fellow co-author Prof Karen Malone, from Western Sydney University, added: \"This report maps the evidence to encourage researchers and policymakers to meet at the interface of research and policy in order to shape a positive future for our children.\"\nFollow Mark on Twitter.", "prompt": "Childhoods were dramatically changing, with fewer opportunities to spend time outdoors, researchers observed.\nThe loss of exposure to the natural environment would have negative long"}

Following gruelling training sessions three times a week at a Yorkshire clinic, she can now cover longer distances of up to a mile in one session.\nIt takes at least two-and-a-half hours for her to complete a mile but she hopes to improve her speed as the weeks pass, staying in a hotel at night-time and starting afresh every morning from the point where she left off the night before.\nIn 2006, Claire's horse Rolled Oats clipped his shoulder, flinging her from the saddle into a nearby tree. The fall broke her neck, back and ribs and left her paralysed from the chest down.\nClaire first saw the \"robot legs\", or ReWalk bionic walking device, while researching her condition on the internet. She jokingly likens the device to Wallace and Gromit's \"wrong trousers\", and with the help of her friends and family raised the £43,000 necessary to get them.\nBut walking in \"techno trousers\" is not as quite as easy as in the Nick Park animation - while the \"wrong trousers\" walk on their own, Claire's require patience, perseverance and intense effort.\nShe says: \"Not feeling my body makes it so hard. I don't know what my feet are doing.\"\nClaire relies on motion sensors to help her move and lift her legs and one of the most difficult things for her has been simply learning to stand on two feet again.\n\"To start with I just had to find my balance without wobbling.\"\nThe London marathon is not the only race Claire is competing in, as she and her one-year-old daughter, Maisie, are battling it out to see who will be the first to walk unaided.\n\"We've had this competition all along so we'll see. She can do 10 steps on her own now. I'm as wobbly as her.\"\nClaire hopes to raise more than £50,000 for Spinal Research, a charity which funds medical research to develop treatments for paralysis.\nFormer rugby player Matt Hampson, who was paralysed after a rugby accident, will provide moral support for part of her marathon journey, as will retired tennis player Tim Henman and former champion British equestrian Lucinda Green.\n\"There's a lot of people who are worse off than me and haven't got the support I've got, so I want to raise as much as I can.\"\nBut, when the marathon is over, Claire thinks that for the first time in six years, she will be delighted to return to her wheelchair.", "prompt": "When Claire was told she would spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair after a spinal injury, she wanted to get back on her feet as quickly"}

Among the elderly, one in three lives below the poverty line. In fact, the most recent official data suggests the poverty rate among people over 65 years of age has risen by 19% between 2009 and 2014.\nCity officials believe the best way to reduce poverty is to expand economic growth and create jobs but elderly people say age-related discrimination is pervasive.\nThat's why Joyce Mak, a former social worker, started the social enterprise 10 years ago.\nShe had no experience in the restaurant business but wanted to provide a sustainable way of employing senior citizens for as long as they were willing to work.\nSince then, Gingko has employed more than 1,000 elderly people.\nBangalore is one of the world's major tech cities.

The grannies have now become more confident. They have become a part of my life and I have become a part of their life, empowering them and making them realise that they can become entrepreneurs at any stage of their life.\"\nLima, a textile design graduate, got the idea for Granny's Love when she saw her mother-in-law knitting. \"I thought if I give her design directions she can come up with something fabulous.\"\nThe business relies on a combination of new technology (the internet and social media apps) and good old-fashioned craft (knitting nans). All orders from the website arrive in Lima's email inbox.\nShe then creates the design, identifies the granny best suited to knit it, and sends the wool and the design to that granny. \"Then, after a week, [the granny] sends back the product, other details are added, and it's packed together with a photo of the granny who made it, and posted to the customer,\" says Lima.\nGetting the customers wasn't a problem. The challenge was to find the grannies and persuade them that knitting was a moneymaking skill.\n\"I would ask any granny I would meet, 'Do you knit? Do you know this craft?'

{"human": "There are around 200 suicides a year of people cared for by crisis teams - three times the number in hospitals.\nA third had been discharged from hospital in the previous fortnight, while a further third had been using the service for less than a week.\nThe University of Manchester report suggests crisis teams in the UK are under too much pressure.\nCrisis resolution/home treatment (CRHT) teams are made up of psychiatrists, mental health nurses, social workers and support workers.\nThey visit patients in their homes, administering medication and offering psychological and practical support.\nBy Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent\nTwenty years ago, there was a broad consensus within the NHS that suicides among psychiatric patients were inevitable.\nThe landscape has now changed.  Medics in Detroit proved that you could cut out all suicides and now the more innovative parts of the NHS are trying to embark on a similar exercise.\nBut reaching that goal requires a culture change.  Not just to appreciate that it is possible, but to invest in the training and other resources that will make it possible.\nToo often, inpatient beds have been cut with the NHS promising the savings will be invested in community services.\nTwenty years of research, with ever increasing suicides under the care of crisis teams, shows that simply hasn't happened. Too many psychiatric patients are still simply being failed.\nOne other important point this research highlights - those NHS trusts that involve families in investigating deaths improve performance.  Why some trusts fail to do so, or engage in some tokenistic efforts, is utterly baffling.\nThe National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness (NCISH) report suggests the teams are bearing the pressure of caring for patients who actually need a more acute level of care, such as inpatient beds.\nIt said crisis teams had become the \"default option\" in acute care \"used for too many patients at high risk\".\nProf Louis Appleby, director of NCISH, said: \"Our findings suggest that we are accepting too much risk in the home treatment these teams offer and that the crisis team is now the priority for suicide prevention in mental health.\"\nThe report suggests people who live alone - as 43% of those who committed suicide did - were at particular risk and that the crisis team may not have been a \"suitable\" level of care.\nPoor access to specialist help for drug and alcohol misuse was also noted by the authors.\nJoy Hibbins suffered a \"horrifying, shocking, terrifying and profoundly distressing\" incident in 2012.  Within days, she was feeling suicidal for the first time in her life, and was directed towards her local crisis team.\n\"I found it almost impossible to engage with them as there were so many of them,\" she says. \"A different person was coming out to see me every day.\n\"When you've been through something extremely traumatic it is hard enough to build trust with one person, never mind a whole team and it meant that I was having to repeat information about the experience to different people.  There was no sense of continuity of care from my perspective.\n\"There are some very good individuals within the crisis teams but there are many issues. They are working very much under pressure. \"\nIn an effort to prevent others from suffering a similar experience, Joy has set up a charity in Gloucestershire which provides round-the-clock support to people contemplating suicide.\nSuicide rates across the UK vary. In general, rates have risen since the 2008 recession - except in Scotland where there has been a sustained fall. The rate is highest in Northern Ireland.\nSamantha Nicklin, head of campaigns at Rethink Mental Illness, said: \"Every suicide is preventable. We are still losing too many brothers, sisters, parents, children and friends this way.\n\"While progress is being made in our understanding of how to support people with mental illness and prevent suicide, we are still seeing people struggling to get the help they need before they reach crisis point, with overstretched services and patchy care across the country.\"\nMarjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said: \"It is a flawed and unacceptable system whereby patients at risk of death by suicide are denied the hospital care that would be given to anyone with life-threatening physical illness and placed in the hands of overworked, understaffed community teams.\n\"We cannot stand by and watch unnecessary deaths because of a principal that everyone, however ill, should be treated in the community.\"", "prompt": "There are around 200 suicides a year of people cared for by crisis teams - three times the number in hospitals.\nA third had been discharged from hospital"}

{"human": "Instead she came out swinging against Donald Trump in a scathing speech that made clear she's looking to appeal to a broad centre in the general election.\nBilled as a national security speech, her address lacked any new proposals. Instead it was a forceful, often mocking, rebuke of the presumptive Republican nominee, as she framed her pitch in patriotic terms that could also resonate with Republicans.\nMrs. Clinton presented herself as the real defender of American values and a commander-in-chief with a steady hand who believed in America as an exceptional country.\nMr Trump on the other hand, \"believes America is weak. An embarrassment. He called our military a disaster. He said we are, and I quote, a third-world country,\" said Mrs Clinton, speaking in San Diego, a city with 95,000 military personnel.\nMrs Clinton was introduced by the spouse of an active duty naval officer and spoke with 20 US flags prominently displayed behind her.\nAlthough still fighting a primary, Mrs. Clinton is clearly making a play for independent and Republican voters who are concerned about Mr Trump's erratic foreign policy pronouncements but also his statements on women, Mexican immigrants and Muslims. On Thursday, the head of Hispanic media relations for the Republican National Committee, Ruth Guerra, resigned.\nMrs Clinton has always had the potential to appeal to moderate Republicans turned off by their party's stance on social issues such as gay marriage, abortion and even guns, but who feel she is tough enough on foreign policy.\nIn late April, during her speech after her victory in the Pennsylvania primary, Mrs Clinton appealed to \"thoughtful\" Republicans, independents and Democrats to stand together against divisive candidates on the Republican side.\nAlthough House speaker Paul Ryan finally endorsed Donald Trump on Thursday after weeks of hesitation, prominent Republicans are not rushing actively to back the presumptive Republican nominee just yet. At least nine Republican governors, and a number of senators, are steering clear from their party convention in July.\nThere has also been a trickle of lifelong, prominent Republicans who openly say they will vote for a Democrat for the first time in their life in November.\nMrs Clinton's message on American global leadership may not resonate widely with the GOP (Grand Old Party; Republican) base which is turning more isolationist - but it is finding an audience with many moderates and foreign policy thinkers.\nOn Twitter, the hashtag #RepublicansforHillary was trending for a day this week, after an interview on US cable TV with a former Reagan administration official, Doug Elmets, who said that \"four years of Hillary Clinton is better than one day with Donald Trump as president\".\nWidely quoted in the US media as well was retired army colonel Peter Mansoor, a former aide to General David Petraeus during the Iraq war.\nMr Mansoor said he would be voting for Mrs Clinton not because he had converted to being a Democrat, but because Mr Trump was dangerous.\nElections are not won on Twitter and a handful of Republicans won't tip the balance in November, but the chatter on social media is bringing out voices from the Republican party silent during the raucous days of the Republican primaries and raising questions about a ripple effect.\nMr Trump has been criticised by leading names such as former secretary of defence Robert Gates, former CIA director Michael Hayden, former Bush administration spokesperson Tony Fratto, historian Max Boot and commentator David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W Bush.\nClinton campaign aides were not willing to discuss their strategy to appeal to moderate Republicans, especially while the Democratic primary is still under way. But they acknowledged there were Republicans, particularly those concerned with foreign policy issues, who could support her.\nVin Weber, a Republican strategist and former congressman who supported Jeb Bush in the primaries, said Mrs Clinton should enlist Republican advisors.\n\"If she were campaigning like her husband, she would move to the centre, and try to get votes that are not locked up by the Republican Party,\" said Mr Weber, who said he was still doing some hard thinking about how to vote in November.\nDemocratic pollster Stanley Greenberg says a recent poll shows moderate Republicans represent a \"stunning 31% of the GOP base\", what he describes the alienated third of the party.\n\"They are disproportionately college graduates in a white, working-class party, and they are socially liberal.\"\nOn marriage equality, climate change or abortion rights, those GOP moderates are more in sync with the Democratic party. The poll, conducted in February when all the Republican candidates were still in the race, showed that 10% of Republican moderates would vote for Clinton.\nKori Schake, a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution, said that Clinton's challenge would be to convince anti-Trump Republicans they actually need to vote for her - not simply refrain from voting for Mr Trump.\n\"Republican refuseniks are not enough to make a difference,\" she said.\nMs Schake said presenting Mr Trump as dangerous was an effective strategy, but it was also key for Mrs Clinton to frame her pitch in economic terms.\nShe had to press home the damage she believed a Trump presidency would cause to the economy - but to do so would require moving decisively to the right of Mr Sanders, and risk alienating many in her own party.\n\"I've just come back from Cuba, and I've seen what a Sanders economy looks like,\" said Ms Schake.\nMrs Clinton will seek to unify the Democratic party ahead of the convention, She will not undo the positions she has taken during the drawn-out primaries to appeal to the Democratic base.\nBut to win those moderates Republicans, she will now need to present herself not just as the candidate of her party's middle but of America's centre.", "prompt": "Instead she came out swinging against Donald Trump in a scathing speech that made clear she's looking to appeal to a broad centre in the general election.\n"}
