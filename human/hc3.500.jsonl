We call that burning process \" combustion. \" Combustion is a chemical reaction. We take two chemicals - say, butane ( a bunch of carbon and hydrogen ) and oxygen - and we put them together. Add a little heat and the chemicals will recombine themselves into different chemicals ( like carbon dioxide and water ).

That's why something that is burning can stay burning until it runs out of fuel. Of course, if it runs out of oxygen before it runs out of fuel will still go out. The chemical reaction needs both to go... but remember, fire is just the result of the energy that the combustion reaction makes. Stars get their energy from somewhere else, not a chemical reaction but a nuclear one. Atoms are smashed together under insane pressure and, when that happens, part of the atom itself becomes energy. The amount of energy is huge so the sun doesn't need nearly as much of its nuclear fuel to burn hot as it would need if it were a chemical reaction like combustion. Either way, that energy heats things up and, on the surface of the sun those things are gasses heated until they glow.

For example : Germany just sold 10 - year debt at a negative yield the other day , and apparently there was actual demand . Please explain like I'm five.", "human": ["Its really not that crazy. Government bonds have been priced at less than inflation pretty often. If the return on a bond is less than the inflation rate, you 're effectively losing money. This isn't a wholly new thing, its just a more severe version. Also don't forget the fact that different currencies exist. If an American were to buy a German bond issued in euros with a negative yield, I could still make money if the dollar sank against euro. Sometimes you just have to have money in government bonds, like a requirement, insurance companies need to have government bonds for reserves, pension funds can need them, and some others. Its a way of regulating that the money exists to back up their responsibility, they ca nt just lose it, people depend on it.", "There's actually several reasons why financial institutions ( such as banks, pension funds, and the like ) buy bonds that yield negative interest. The first reason is fairly straightforward: the assets that financial instutions can or need to hold have become increasingly regulated, especially in light of the recent financial crises. Some regulators have imposed requirements on banks to maintain a certain portion of safe and liquid assets ( meaning they can easily be sold off for cash ). The aim of such regulatory intervention is to ensure that those financial institutions are able to get quick access to cash in case of a crisis. The downside, however, is that this increases demand for \" safe \" assets immensely, to the point where all that may be left for some institutions to buy is bonds with negative yields. In short, the institutions are then forced by those regulatory requirements to buy those negative - yield assets. A second, equally important reason, might seem paradoxical at first: financial institutions may hope to actually earn money on those bonds despite their negative yields. One way negative - yield bonds can turn out to be profitable is simply when the financial institution can sell it for a higher price than the one at which it bought the bond ( e. g. if it paid 100 USD for a bond and can sell it for 105 USD ). Such increases in value can, for instance, occur when the bond is valued in a different currency. If, for example, a US bank buys German bonds, it can make a profit by selling those bonds after the euro becomes more valuable ( e. g. a bank buying a bond denominated in euro at 100 euro makes a profit when the euro \" appreciates \" ( i. e. becomes more valuable ). Rather than being worth 100 USD ( if the original exchange rate was 1 USD to 1 euro ), the bond would then be worth for instance 105 USD ( if the new exchange rate is 1 USD to 1. 05 euro ). A more subtle way to make a \" profit \" on a negative - yield bond is when the bond is simply the least bad option. A lot of central banks charge a negative interest to banks for depositing their money with them. If the negative yield on the bond is lower than the negative interest charged by the central bank, it is preferable to buy the bond. After all, while the bank will still lose money, it will lose less money than if it went for the alternative, i. e. taking the central bank's negative interest. The same goes when there is \" deflation \", i. e. when money becomes less valuable over time. If your money loses value, it would be preferable to invest in a bond whose negative yield is lower than the money you would lose just keeping the cash.", "[ I have asked this question before ] ( URL_0 ), and got a very good discussion going... here is the major point, to me: When you have a large amount of cash, you have to put it somewhere. Parking $ 100, 000, 000 in a bank is not risk - free. Taking it out in $ 100 ( or 100 euro ) bills turns cash into something * physical *, needing storage and protection - you can't just stick it in the basement. And with interest rates so low, you may actually be * charged * to hold money at a bank. So the purchase of negative yield bonds might be cheaper than the bank fees. Investing in government bonds, even with a negative yield, might be better than basically making an unsecured loan to a bank."]}
{"prompt": "How exactly does dealing in stock make me money?", "human": ["Generally, a share of stock entitles the owner to all future per-share dividends paid by the company, plus a fraction of the company's assets net value in the event of liquidation. If one knew in advance the time and value of all such payouts, the value of the stock should equal the present cash value of that payout stream, which would in turn be the sum of the cash values of all the individual payouts. As time goes by, the present cash value of each upcoming payout will increase until such time as it is actually paid, whereupon it will cease to contribute to the stock's value. Because people are not clairvoyant, they generally don't know exactly what future payouts a stock is going to make. A sane price for a stock, however, may be assigned by estimating the present cash value of its future payments. If unfolding events would cause a reasonable person to revise estimates of future payments upward, the price of the stock should increase. If events cause estimates to be revised downward, the price should fall. In a sane marketplace, if the price of a stock is below people's estimates of its payouts' current cash value, people should buy the stock and push the price upward. If it is above people's estimates, they should sell the stock and push the price downward. Note that in a sane marketplace, rising prices are a red-flag indicator for people to stop buying. Unfortunately, sometimes bulls see a red flag as a signal to charge ahead. When that happens, prices may soar through the roof, but it's important to note that the value of the stock will still be the present cash value of its future payouts. If that value is $10/share, someone who buys a share for $50 basically gives the seller $40 that he was not entitled to, and which the buyer will never get back. The buyer might manage to convince someone else to pay him $60 for the share, but that simply means the new buyer is giving the the previous one $50 that he wasn't entitled to either. If the price falls back to $10, calling that fall a \"market correction\" wouldn't be a euphemism, but rather state a fact: the share was worth $10 before people sold it for crazy prices, and still worth $10 afterward. It was the market price that was in error. The important thing to focus on as a sane investor is what the stock is actually going to pay out in relation to what you put in. It's not necessary to look only at present price/earnings ratios, since some stocks may pay little or nothing today but pay handsomely next year. What's important, however, is that there be a reasonable likelihood that in the foreseeable future the stock will pay dividends sufficient to justify its cost."]}

{"prompt": "Why do the US only have two political parties represented in their legislature ? I 'm from NZ . I do n't get it . Explain like I'm five.", "human": ["I'm not sure how the NZ government works, but in the US, there are 2 main reasons why there are only two political parties ( contrasted with a Parliamentary system ): ( 1 ) districting and ( 2 ) first past the post elections. Every state is divided up into districts proportional to population. Wyoming ( small population ) only has one district; California ( the largest population ) has 53. Each of these districts has its own elections to elect one Representative who goes to the lower legislature. In the House of Representatives, each state is represented proportionally to its population. Each state also has a state - wide election to select its Senators ( who go to the upper legislature ). Each state has 2 Senators, so every state has equal footing in the Senate. Senators are elected independently from each other, so many states ( like Alaska ) have one Republican ( conservative ) and one Democratic ( liberal ) senator. For legislative elections ( that is, not for the President, which has its own screwy system ), the US uses a type of voting called \" first past the post. \" Within each election, people vote for whoever they want. At the end, the candidate with the most votes wins. This sounds all fine and dandy, but it introduces the possibility of a \" spoiler \" candidate. Let's say there are three candidates running: Anna, Betty, and Charlene. Anna and Betty share many similar views on current issues, but differ on one or two issues. Charlene differs from the others on nearly every issue. Let's say that at the end, Anna receives 35 % of the vote, Betty receives 25 % of the vote, and Charlene receives 40 % of the vote. Charlene would win the election. However, the presence of Betty means that Anna didn't win, and vice versa. This is a problem because 60 %, a majority, of the voting population more or less agrees with Anna and Betty's political positions, and yet Charlene won the election. So as you can see, there is a strong negative pressure to introduce a third party. You may have heard in the last year or two things about the \" Tea Party \" - this is an extremely conservative branch of the Republican ( conservative ) party. And yet they haven't split off from the Republicans - if they were to do so, they might be the spoiler candidate in the general election, giving the Democrats ( liberals ) a potentially strong benefit in the election. Instead, they remain within the Republican party and try to knock off more moderate Republicans so it remains a two - party race against the Democrats. Another part of the reason that more people don't vote for a third party is that they'd be afraid of wasting their vote and causing the spoiler candidate to pick up too many votes. So voting is less about who you * want * to win and more about who you * don't * want to win. Let's go back to Anna, Betty, and Charlene. Let's say you really support Betty, but you would rather have Anna over Charlene. How should you vote? Anna is ahead in pre - election polls, so you 're afraid that if you vote for Betty, Charlene might win ( as in the case above ) - that's a case that you should vote for Anna. But you would still rather have Betty in office rather than Anna. Ok, my brain hijacked this a little bit into an argument for [ instant runoff voting ] ( URL_0 ). Sorry about that.

This seems to be becoming less true in the last several years, with liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats more or less ceasing to exist. If that continues, with each party occupying an ever narrower place on the ideological spectrum, eventually other parties will spring up to represent those opinions. Also, we don't have a parliamentary system or a proportional representation electoral system. Both of those things tend to lead to multiple, smaller parties with narrowly specific ideologies. Our system with first - past - the - post elections and the legislative and executive functions of government kept separate, leads to the opposite situation.

In case you 're interested, here are the lessons to learn from this game: 1. Developing your pieces out into the centre quickly. Every piece is better in the centre of the board. ( e. g. A Knight can only move to 2 different squares if it starts from the corner, but to 8 different squares if it starts in the centre. ) If you don't get your pieces out quickly and your opponent does, you can often get attacked quickly. 2.

Since that wins the game, sacrifices to expose / weaken the King are the most common kind of sacrifice. 3. Having active co - ordinated pieces. This ties in with points 1 and 2. Having pieces in the centre makes them very active and dangerous to an exposed King.

( There are certain things not covered, of course. ) Single - payer would never have passed in the US, so they compromised and used a partially privatised solution. Americans still use private insurance, but the government introduced subsidies to lower the cost of it, and enacted a large amount of reform, including mandating a minimum amount of coverage they have to offer, laws against different pricing based on sex or pre - existing conditions. There are a lot of similarities between the two- the ACA tried to take healthcare to a similar place, covering everyone, through market competition ( private hospitals and insurance companies ) plus subsidies rather than through a government monopoly on it. Now whether or not they 've succeeded...

It is a part of their government, dominated by the Scottish Nationalist Party that wants it. As for the reason why, it is a mix of sentiment and economy. At present, the land of Scotland is a part of the United Kingdom ( made up of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England ). For this reason, many of Scotland's policies are not decided by a Scottish parliament, but rather by the superseding combined government, which resides in London. So for instance, when the United Kingdom decided to go to war against Iraq in 2003, the Scottish people were obliged to go along. And when the United Kingdom enters an agreement within the Nato, the Scottish people have no say in it. Some Scottish people ( united in the Scottish Nationalist Party ) are not happy with this state of affairs. Furthermore, it turns out that Scotland is rather rich in natural resources, such as oil from the North Sea and single malt whisky. As matters stand, the proceedings of exploiting this richness are going for a very large part to persons of not Scottish origin. Again, this is reason for the Scottish National Party to cry foul. As for the effects of an independent Scotland: I personally think it would become more or less like the Republic of Ireland, minus the Euro. Which would not be bad. The Scottish would take control of their natural resources, leaving England with a lot less money to spend. This in turn would have its negative effect on the role that England ( through it's United Kingdom ) is able to play in todays world."]}

What on earth are they spending so much money on ? Explain like I'm five. ", "human": ["It costs money to maintain the business as well as expand and grow. The revenue is the total amount of money made by the business BEFORE the costs are put into the equation. Things that they could be spending money on: Research and development, Employee salaries, server maintenance, garden gnomes, merger / acquisition ( buying smaller companies ), Debt ( companies borrow huge amounts of money to grow themselves )", "As others have already pointed out, Twitter is an expensive operation. I want to drill down on one specific aspect of its operations. If you talked to anyone at Twitter, they would actually tell you that they made a net profit this last quarter: > * Q4 GAAP net loss of $ 167 million and * * non - GAAP net income of $ 119 million * *. ^(_- from their SEC filings, emphasis mine _ ) That's quite a big difference! What is this GAAP and non - GAAP business and why does it give such wildly different profit models? Herein lies one of the costliest aspect of Twitter's operation: * * employee retention * *. This is a well - known secret within the tech industry, and it is somewhat peculiar that a ( relatively, by the tech standard ) mature company has to spend so much money to keep a reasonable tenure rate that it's pushing their profit margins into the black hemisphere. * * GAAP vs OLD NAVY * * GAAP and non - GAAP are two different accounting models that the CFO and his analysts use to compile Twitter's financials. In simple terms, GAAP is the model that the security exchange wants, and the non - GAAP model basically takes some of the expenses of running Twitter, and reasons that they are \" self - reinvesting \" enough that they shouldn't be accounted for as an expense altogether. For Twitter, their non - GAAP trick is to magically erase the impact of \" Stock - based compensation expense \" and \" restructuring changes \". In other words, they don't believe that their accountants should really care about what they have to pay their employees to show up everyday because that's not really reflective of whether they will succeed. Of course, this raises several questions. * * Why would anyone care about the no - compensation model in the first place? * * Compensation is as much of a cost of operations as RnD, servers, physical assets, or a host of other expenses required to keep Twitter chugging along. This is obviously the opinion of the SEC as well, so why does Twitter even think it can get away with reporting a, quote, \" non - GAAP net income of $ 119 million \"? Well, it turns out that there is some precedence for evaluating a company's * potential * even when they are not profitable. For many early companies, shelling out for good talent from time to time ( or during growth sprees ) isn't really an ominous thing. Nevertheless, standard accounting of their financials would lead your shareholders to believe that, because Foofle brought on an expensive director this year, its profit suffered. For healthy companies, excluding these expenses actually can give shareholders more clarity on the long - term direction of their company. So far everything seems reasonable, but there's more to Twitter than meets the eye. * * Why are Twitter's financials peculiar? * * Well, it's actually not that difficult to answer. Including both stock compensation and restructuring fees, Twitter spends around $ 240 m to make sure that their employees keep coming into work every morning. With a total revenue of $ 700 m, that's over a third of its total revenue! ( For reference, Facebook, who pays the third most to retain employees, only pays out 15 % of their total revenue ) No other comparable companies in that vertical, or even in tech in general, spends that much to keep their employees. Why is Twitter having trouble here? Well, the fact of the matter is, the RSUs ( stock units / shares in Twitter ) that the company grants to its employers is losing value every quarter. If you look at the historical price per share since Twitter went public, it's been dipping monotonically. As a result, the shares that were granted to an employee is only worth a fraction of the prices that they are worth when they were granted. ( Some of this depends on the technicality of how those shares vest / when they can be sold ). Obviously, people are generally not very happy when they are holding what appears to be a depreciating asset. As a result, to keep their employees happy, Twitter will re - issue refresher stocks each year to compensate for the depreciation in the value of their equity, as well as a bit extra as a bonus ( probably ). So what's wrong with that? Nothing. It's just that Twitter's performing so poorly that, to keep their compensation competitive, they 're actually eating up a third of its revenue in order to keep their engineers, their strategist, and their other employees happy. But there's some good news for Twitter at least. This percentage of total revenue that goes towards employee retention is declining every year ( it was about 50 % back in 2014 ). For the most part, this is mostly due to increasing revenue. However, if they become GAAP profitable and beat earnings, their stock prices will probably go up. At that point, their employees stocks will suddenly become an appreciating asset. As a result, they 'll probably also stop bleeding so much money out to compensation.", "From Twitter's official filings as a public company URL_0 - Revenue 717, 206 - Cost of revenue -305, 710 - Research and development -202, 128 - Sales and marketing -260, 603 - General and administrative -92, 392 Cost of revenue = servers and operations staff to keep servers running R+D = developers to make new features for twitter S+M = advertising Twitter itself, sales staff to reach out to companies and have them advertise on twitter"]}
{"prompt": "Would open source credit score formulas be feasible?", "human": ["The major bureaus use the Fair Isaac scoring model, for the most part. Here's an excerpt from a web site (Versions of the FICO scoring model) to explain: One of the first things a newcomer to this board learns is the difference between FICO and FAKO scores. FAKO refers to the non-FICO scores offered by various companies. FAKO scores have little value since few of them are used by lenders and they do not match closely to FICO scores. But even when you stick with FICO scores, confusion can ensue because FICO scores have many different editions, versions, and variations. On a single day, a consumer could theoretically have dozens of different FICO scores, depending on which version and credit agency is used to produce the score. This post provides a summary of the various FICO versions. Please offer any corrections or updates, and they will be edited in. The FICO scoring model with its familiar range of 300 to 850 was first introduced in 1989. Since then, FICO has released five major revisions: 1995, 1998, 2004, 2008, and 2014. Each \"edition\" uses a different formula and produces a different score. When a new FICO edition is released, many lenders continue using an older version for years before \"upgrading. \" The 1995 revision is no longer in common use, but later editions are still used by lenders. Most FICO editions are commonly known by the year of introduction: FICO 98, FICO 04, and FICO 08 (although FICO now calls it FICO Score 8, without the zero). The most recent edition is FICO Score 9 introduced in 2014. As of 2014, FICO Score 8 is the most commonly used. However, most mortgage lenders use FICO 04 for Equifax and Transunion, and FICO 98 for Experian. In addition to the \"classic\" version, FICO offers \"Industry Option\" versions customized for auto loans, credit cards, installment loans, personal finance loans, and insurance. These have a score range of 250 to 900, so the scores are not fully comparable with \"classic\" versions. As of 2015, Auto and Bankcard scores are available from myFICO as described here. Citibank provides the Equifax FICO 8 Bankcard score free each month to credit cards holders. Each credit agency (Transunion, Equifax, and Experian) uses a customized version of each FICO edition. As a result, a consumer's FICO scores from each agency may differ even when all credit information is identical among the agencies. Because there are many FICO versions, when a score is received, it's helpful to know which version it is. If a lender provides a credit score, ask for details such as which credit agency was used, which FICO edition was used, and whether the score is an Industry Option version. The lender may not always be willing or able to provide the answers, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

Real-world score range: 316 to 850 (as shown on this Experian document) How FICO Score 8 differs from previous versions is explained here. In May 2014, a poster named android01 received 850 scores from all three credit agencies, as described in this post. In June 2014, a poster named fused received 850 scores from all three credit agencies, as described in this post. This 2011 press release describes a study of FICO Score 8 scores. From a sample of 250, 000 credit reports, it found 0. 02% had a score of 850, or about 1 out of every 5000 persons. In 2014, FICO announced a new version called FICO Score 9. More info here. As of February 2016, the score is now available directly to consumers, as described here. This New York Times article says FICO 9 includes two important changes: unpaid debts that result in collection actions will no longer have a negative effect on a score if the debt has been paid. unpaid medical debts will have less negative effect on scores. In 2001, FICO released a new scoring model called NextGen. It is claimed to be an improvement over \"classic\" FICO models because it tracks more factors. But it has failed to catch on with lenders because its score range of 150 to 950 is incompatible with the familiar 300 to 850 range, requiring lenders to recalculate cutoff scores and revise many rules and policies. Only a small percentage of lenders reportedly use NextGen. Transunion Official name: Precision Available directly to consumers: No Equifax Official name: Pinnacle Available directly to consumers: In 2014, Pentagon Federal Credit Union (PenFed) began to provide this score free to its credit card holders, as discussed in this post. Experian Official name: FICO Advanced Risk Score Available directly to consumers: No I included all of this to make the point that there are many variations of the scoring models, and all of them are customized to one degree or another by each of the major bureaus as a means of giving their models more credibility, as far as they're concerned. To your question about coming up with a \"fair\" scoring model, can you propose what makes current scoring models unfair? I think it's a safe assumption to make that the financial community has already had a substantial amount of input into how the current scoring models work. To think otherwise implies that the credit bureaus are just kinda \"winging it\" with whatever they think is best. Their models are designed to give their client creditors the best scoring model possible based on what those creditors have stated is important to them. There isn't a unified single scoring model out there, and the bureaus definitely won't share the details of their modifications. You can always come up with your own custom model, but how it compares to what's widely used, that's anyone's guess. I hope this helps. Good luck!"]}

Dividends though are not guaranteed, as the company may incur losses or the management may decide to use the cash for future growth instead of disbursing it to the shareholders.

{"prompt": "Keeping our current home (second property) as a rental. Will it interfere with purchasing a third home?", "human": ["There's a couple issues to consider: When you sell your primary home, the IRS gives you a $500k exemption (married, filing jointly) on gain. If you decide not to sell your current house now, and you subsequently fall outside the ownership/use tests, then you may owe taxes on any gains when you sell the house. Rather than being concerned about your net debt, you should be concerned about your monthly debt payments. Generally speaking, you cannot have debt payments of more than 36% of your monthly income. If you can secure a renter for your current property, then you may be able to reach this ratio for your next (third) property. Also, only 75% of your expected monthly rental income is considered for calculating your 36% number. (This is not an exhaustive list of risks you expose yourself to). The largest risk is if you or your spouse find yourself without income (e. g. lost job, accident/injury, no renter), then you may be hurting to make your monthly debt payments. You will need to be confident that you can pay all your debts. A good rule that I hear is having the ability to pay 6 months worth of debt. This may not necessarily mean having 6 months worth of cash on hand, but access to that money through personal lines of credit, borrowing against assets, selling stocks/investments, etc. You also want to make sure that your insurance policies fully cover you in the event that a tenant sues you, damages property, etc. You also don't want to face a situation where you are sued because of discrimination.

It is relevant once again, for the reason that is gives states proper representation and it prevents candidates from abusing popular vote. With the whole \" Why should I vote? \" question, many electoral college members vote based on the popular vote of the state. Some states even divide their votes and give portions to the candidates based on the popular vote ratio. The electoral college has worked fairly well for the past 200 years, except for two occasions.

All the money would go to urban development, mass transit, and city parks.

At the same time, NASSCO, a california shipyard, was in trouble. Not selling enough ships, not getting enough new work, bleak future. Congress, and the Navy, saw an opportunity.

{"prompt": "How does electricity work ? What is the relationship between volts , amps , ohms etc . and electricity ? What are their place within electrical theory ? Thanks ! Please explain like I'm five.", "human": ["These answers are still a little complicated, so let me try to put it in terms an actual 5 year old could understand: I always think of it in terms of a flowing river, URL_0 puts it quite clearly in terms of plumbing: \" A neat analogy to help understand these terms is a system of plumbing pipes. The voltage is equivalent to the water pressure, the current is equivalent to the flow rate, and the resistance is like the pipe size. \" This shows how all three ( volts amps and ohms ) are always proportional to each other. Now as far as how we create this current there are two different approaches, AC and DC. DC would be like one constant stream of water flowing through the pipes, whereas AC would be more like moving the same water back and forth very quickly through the pipes.", "You may know this, but in going to start off by saying electricity is the flow of electrical charge. In wires this is electrons, but in things like say water this is ions ( atoms that have gained or lost electrical an electron and are no longer neutral ) from dissolved salts. Electrical current is much the same as water current. If you had, a flow rate for a hose, it would be measured in volume per time. Litres or gallons or m^3 per second or minute or hour. Electrical current is much the same, but instead of volume per time it's charge per time. An amp ( A ) is the unit of this current. Amps say how much charge is flowing. So many electrons per second. Charge is measured in coulombs ( C ). An amp is one C / s. An electron is something like 1. 6x10 ^ -19. If you don't know scientific notation, that 1. 6 divided by ten nineteen times, a very small number. That means a C is a lot of electrons, so an amp is a lot of electrons flowing by each second. Electrical potential or voltage is kinda like gravitational potential. The higher an object is the more energy it will have when it falls, this means it has more gravitational potential. Electrical potential ( measured in volts ) is how much energy electrical charge has when it moves between two points. Voltages are always stated between two points, like say the two terminals of a battery. One terminal of a battery by itself can't be stated to have a voltage. A volt is a joule / coulomb. A joule is a unit of energy, about 1/4 of a calorie. This means if a nine volt battery has one coulomb worth of electrons flow through a light bulb from its terminals, the electrons release one joule of heat and light energy. Or if it was a motor one joule of mechanical energy. If you multiply current by voltage, it's J / C * C / s. Notice the C's cancel and you have a J / S. A joule per second is also known as a watt, a unit of power. Power is energy per time. The power an electrical devices uses is determined by how many amps it draws and what voltage it is supplied by. Resistance is kinda what it sounds like, its how hard of time electrical charge has flowing. The higher something's resistance, the harder it is for current to flow. An ohm Ω is the unit of resistance. One ohm is a volt per amp. What this means is if you apply one volt to an object with one Ω of resistance, one amp will flow. If the object had one volts again but two Ω, half an amp will flow. If it had half an Ω, two amps will flow. It's a relation between how much current comes out when you apply a voltage, amd it stems from how hard of time the charge has moving. In a wire where electrons are moving, think of it like a game of [ plinko ] ( URL_0 ). The electrons are the balls, the voltage is the steepness, and the atoms of the wire are the pegs. As gravity moves the ball down, it collides with pegs that slow it down. Resistance is kinda similar.", "Simply put electricity is the movement of electrons. Voltage ( measured in volts ) is energy per charge, it's the amount of energy stored in the the electrons. If one side of a battery has a high energy and the other side has a low energy the electrons move from the high energy to the lower energy. Current ( measured in amps ) is measure of charge per second, so if you have a wire and electrons are moving from a higher energy to a lower energy it measures how many electrons are moving through the wire. Resistance ( measured in ohms ) is a measure of how easy it is for the electrons to move through a material. Something like copper has a low resistance so electrons zip through easily, something like wood has a high resistance and electrons can't move through very easily. Ohms law gives the relationship between these three mathematically with this equation: V = I / R where V is voltage, I is current, and R is restiance. EDIT: As pointed out below, Ohms law is V = I*R"]}

{"prompt": "Why do stocks track the price of Oil? ", "human": ["Anthony Russell - I agree with JohnFx. Petroleum is used in making many things such as asphalt, road oil, plastic, jet fuel, etc. It's also used in some forms of electricity generation, and some electric cars use gasoline as a backup form of energy, petrol is also used in electricity generation outside of cars. Source can be found here. But to answer your question of why shares of electric car companies are not always negatively related to one another deals with supply and demand. If investors feel positively about petroleum and petroleum related prospects, then they are going to buy or attempt to buy shares of \"X\" petrol company. This will cause the price of \"X\", petrol company to rise, ceteris paribus. Just because the price of petroleum is high doesn't mean investors are going to buy shares of an electric car company. Petrol prices could be high, but numerous electric car companies could be doing poorly, now, with that being said you could argue that sales of electric cars may go up when petrol prices are high, but there are numerous factors that come into play here. I think it would be a good idea to do some more research if you are planning on investing. Also, remember, after a company goes public they no longer set the price of the shares of their stock. The price of company \"X\" shares are determined by supply and demand, which is inherently determined by investors attitudes and expectations, ultimately defined by past company performance, expectations of future performance, earnings, etc. . It could be that when the market is doing well - it's a good sign of other macroeconomic variables (employment, GDP, incomes, etc) and all these factors power how often individuals travel, vacation, etc. It also has to deal with the economy of the country producing the oil, when you have OPEC countries selling petrol to the U. S. it is likely much cheaper per barrel than domestic produced and refined petrol because of the labor laws, etc. So a strong economy may be somewhat correlated with oil prices and a strong market, but it's not necessarily the case that strong oil prices drive the economy. . I think this is a great research topic that cannot be answered in one post. . Check this article here. From here you can track down what research the Fed of Cleveland has done concerning this.

In order to do that, you would need to understand the 'minds' of all the market players. These days many of these players are secret proprietary algorithms. I'm not quibbling with the specifics of these explanations (I have no better) just pointing out that these are just really hypotheses and if the market starts following different patterns, they will be tossed into the dust bin of 'old thinking'. I think the best thing you can explain to your son is that the stock market is basically a gigantic highly complex poker game. The daily gyrations of the market are about individuals trying to predict where the herd is going to go next and then after that and then after that etc. If you want to help him understand the market, I suggest two things. The first is to find or create a simple market game and play it with him. The other would be to teach him about how bonds are priced and why prices move the way they do. I know this might sound weird and most people think bonds are esoteric but there are bonds have a much simpler pricing model based on fundamental financial logic. It's much easier then to get your head around the moves of the bond markets because the part of the price based on beliefs is much more limited (i. e. will the company be able pay & where are rates going. ) Once you have that understanding, you can start thinking about the different ways stocks can be valued (there are many) and what the market movements mean about how people are valuing different companies. With regard to this specific situation, here's a different take on it from the 'priced in' explanation which isn't really different but might make more sense to your son: Pretend for a second that at some point these stocks did move seasonally. In the late fall and winter when sales went up, the stock price increased in kind. So some smart people see this happening every year and realize that if they bought these stocks in the summer, they would get them cheap and then sell them off when they go up. More and more people are doing this and making easy money. So many people are doing it that the stock starts to rise in the Summer now. People now see that if they want to get in before everyone else, they need to buy earlier in the Spring. Now the prices start rising in the Spring. People start buying in the beginning of the year... You can see where this is going, right? Essentially, a strategy to take advantage of well known seasonal patterns is unstable. You can't profit off of the seasonal changes unless everyone else in the market is too stupid to see that you are simply anticipating their moves and react accordingly."]}

When the Swiss franc appreciates, some companies suffer a lot from that and other less. It depends on their product portfolio, competitors, and other factors. The last decades have shown that how the Swiss Franc valuation is less and less correlated with the performance of the Swiss economy. The Swiss franc is used as a safe haven when the global economy goes bad or is uncertain. In those times, the Swiss franc can be overevaluated, at least as compared to the purchasing power. When the global economy is improving, the over-appreciation of the Swiss franc tends to disapear; this is happening now (in Mid-2017). As a summary, the Swiss franc itself is not truly correlated with the competitiveness of the Swiss economy, but more about how people in the world are anxious.

You also want to avoid using any material that has a hard surface, but isn't rigid. Imagine attaching two springs with hard metal plates to your sticks, then smacking one into the other.

{"prompt": "What does a well diversified self-managed investment portfolio look like?", "human": ["I would like to first point out that there is nothing special about a self-managed investment portfolio as compared to one managed by someone else. With some exceptions, you can put together exactly the same investment portfolio yourself as a professional investor could put together for you. Not uncommonly, too, at a lower cost (and remember that cost is among the, if not the, best indicator(s) of how your investment portfolio will perform over time). Diversification is the concept of not \"putting all your eggs in one basket\". The idea here is that there are things that happen together because they have a common cause, and by spreading your investments in ways such that not all of your investments have the same underlying risks, you reduce your overall risk. The technical term for risk is generally volatility, meaning how much (in this case the price of) something fluctuates over a given period of time. A stock that falls 30% one month and then climbs 40% the next month is more volatile than one that falls 3% the first month and climbs 4% the second month. The former is riskier because if for some reason you need to sell when it is down, you lose a larger portion of your original investment with the former stock than with the latter. Diversification, thus, is reducing commonality between your investments, generally but not necessarily in an attempt to reduce the risk of all investments moving in the same direction by the same amount at the same time. You can diversify in various ways: Do you see where I am going with this? A well-diversed portfolio will tend to have a mix of equity in your own country and a variety of other countries, spread out over different types of equity (company stock, corporate bonds, government bonds, ... ), in different sectors of the economy, in countries with differing growth patterns. It may contain uncommon classes of investments such as precious metals. A poorly diversified portfolio will likely be restricted to either some particular geographical area, type of equity or investment, focus on some particular sector of the economy (such as medicine or vehicle manufacturers), or so on. The poorly diversified portfolio can do better in the short term, if you time it just right and happen to pick exactly the right thing to buy or sell. This is incredibly hard to do, as you are basically working against everyone who gets paid to do that kind of work full time, plus computer-algorithm-based trading which is programmed to look for any exploitable patterns. It is virtually impossible to do for any real length of time. Thus, the well-diversified portfolio tends to do better over time."]}

What's knocking? An engine needs gas to provide energy to run, and this is realized by combustion of the fuel. If the air around it was hot enough to set it alight, it knocks your engine. This is because it is the job of the spark plug to do that, and when an engine ignites spontaneously due to compression, it leads to uneven burn of the fuel. , thus leading to vibrations in your engine. The majority of cars are designed to run on regular gas. Higher - performance cars often require premium gas because their engines are designed for higher compression ( higher compression = more power ), and regular gas may cause knocking.

( Were not going to go into detail here, [ read and watch the animation ] ( URL_1 ) ) If you were designing a car and you wanted it to go faster one of the things you could do was design it for * higher compression *. Higher compression is this: When the piston comes up in the cylinder it squeezes the fuel / air mixture tighter and puts it under more pressure. Why? Because a tighter squeeze means a bigger bang! Which = more power. The downside to this is when compression gets too high the fuel / air mixture can automatically ignite itself without the spark plug; this is bad because the timing of the explosion will be off and can cause damage and less performance. Higher octane fuel is based on fuels resistance to [ preignite ] ( URL_0 ). The higher the number the better that fuel is at resisting igniting itself under higher pressure Extra credit: Compression is normally rated in a X: 1 ratio. Or, taking X units of volume and compressing them into 1 For example a 9: 1 Compression ratio is taking 9 units of space and putting it into 1. Comparitively a 10: 1 ratio would mean higher compression because you 're trying to pack more in. Does that make sense? Picture it like this. You have a box and that you 're trying to pack with springs. If you try to put 9 springs in a box the lid will try to push open on you. Now if you try to put 10 or 11 springs in a box the little with push harder! And that s where it all makes sense to you OP", "There is no * benefit * for most vehicles. Your vehicle was designed with a specific octane in mind, most modern vehicles can run on other octanes, but may suffer inefficiencies for it ( especially if you put lower octane in a car that requires higher ). If you 're not sure, look in your owners manual or call the manufacturer of the car, they 'll tell you what the best octane to use is. Older cars can knock with the wrong octane, but modern cars with computers can compensate for the differences. Higher end sports cars will perform better, for instance, with higher octane gasoline."]}

A turbocharger instead is connected to the exhaust pipes, and it uses the exhaust gases to move the turbines, which force more air into the engine. The advantage of a supercharger is that it has instant power, as a turbo needs time to spool up from the exhaust gases.

AI involves decision making based on algorithms and heuristics. Conventionally, without the use of machine learning, those algorithms are pre - programmed by a human being and dictates the action the AI will take, no matter how stupid the action turns out to be. This means that AI without machine learning is only as \" smart \" as the programmer programmed it to be, so if the algorithm the AI follows is flawed or sub - optimal ( which is the fault of the programmer ), the AI will always make that bad choice. This is where AI with machine learning comes in. Without going too much into the technical details, the AI is programmed with an objective in mind and is tasked to achieve it, but is not told how to achieve it. It hence performs different actions determined at random, each time figuring out what helps it get closer to its objective and what hinders it. From there it literally \" learns \" how to achieve the objective by selecting and remembering the actions that helped it get closer to the objective, and after numerous tries - sometimes thousands, depending on the complexity of the task - it will develop its own algorithm.", "> both involve a machine to learn certain tasks and evolve over time and get better at it.

Really , please actually explain it like you would to a 5 year old . Explain like I'm five.", "human": ["That's a pretty broad question. I think it's really 3 questions in one, so I 'll try to tackle each one individually. * * What's the difference between 2 G, 3 G, and 4 G? * * Imagine there is a deliver service. At the beginning they have a very basic setup of just a few horses that run on small local roads. It can only deliver a small amount of packages a day because of constraints on the delivery center, the amount you can put on your horses, and the 1 lane roads you 're stuck using. That's basically 2 G or EDGE service. A few years later after government regulators agree that they 're doing a good job and will help widen the roads and everyone thinks it's a good time to update the entire delivery centers and buy some trucks. Now everyone have a much larger facility for moving packages / data from point A to point B. There are also new larger trucks that can fit more per load, and the roads are now bigger for everyone to drive more load through. Great! You 've got 3 G! 3 G operates pretty fast but soon everyone and their mom want to send packages so the government says ok, we 'll reserve some highway space, some 16 - wheeler trucks, and automated systems in delivery centers to get packages moved as quickly as possible. Now you 're at 4 G speed, you can now move A LOT of data at once. In this analogy the delivery centers are the switch centers at the major telecom companies. To move more data through with each new generation of service ( 2 G, 3 G, 4 G ) the equipment need to be updated. The roads in this are basically spectrum frequency. Which are regulated by the government / FCC. The feds have to sell or free up additional spectrum for telecom companies to operate more data on the higher frequency channels. Trucks are basically the underlying internet backbone that can accommodate for more and faster data transmission. Without all 3 upgrading almost at the same speed, it's impossible to move from from one generation to the next. Also, your cell phones have to upgrade to the latest generation of processors too because high data - speeds require faster chips to process it. ---------------- * * So how does my cell phone communicate data wirelessly? * * Think of your phone as a just like a mailbox that you leave a request letter in the morning for Youtube. The delivery guy picks up your letter requesting a large order of videos from Youtube and delivers it to them. In the letter you ask \" Please send me a video on XYZ to my address. \" When Youtube gets your request via the delivery service, it will package it all up and send you the video as many large packages. Depending on the speed of the delivery centers, size of the trucks, and width of the road the packages can arrive slowly one by one or really fast almost instantaneously. 2 G, 3 G, and 4 G are just different agreed upon standards the service centers, trucks, and roads that are built. The newer generations are faster at delivering packages. Think of your phone as almost like a mailbox. With each new generation of technology, it has to be bigger, stronger, and more automated to support all the packages / data that you 've ordered. If you have an old phone that's using 2 G, it's pretty much like a tiny mailbox that the deliver service just says \" Nope, it won't be able to handle the load. If you want to use our 3 G service, upgrade it so we can fit these larger boxes in. \" ------------------ * * How does the data go from your phone to the receiving tower and then get moved to Youtube? * * Scatter around the entire world are cell phone towers, hundreds of thousands of them. They 're like listening stations that can talk directly with your phone when it's near. When you turn your cell phone one or walk within range of a new tower, the phone will ask \" who's the closes cell tower? \" A lot of towers will reply by shouting back \" Tower XYZ, I'm here! \", \" Tower ABC, I'm here. \" Depending on how clear your phone hears the response, your phone will start a conversation with one that has the highest quality connection and sounds the clearest. Each cell phone tower is connected to a landline that's hookup to the internet. It acts as an intermediary that passes on your request from the phone, to the tower, from the tower through the landline, into the internet, and through to Youtube. Youtube then replies, passes the video right back. No magical satellite is needed unless you 're somewhere super remote and it's cheaper for the cell tower to talk to the satellite than it is to lay down some land lines to the tower. If you want to get a bit more technical, 3 G and 4 G differences are more than just more bandwidth but requires all new equipment by the cell phone carriers to handle all of the new extra load. It takes forever for some places to move to 4 G from 3 G because of the cost of setting up new infrastructure. Upgrading costs millions of dollars that require faster computers, more expensive connections, and new software to handle everything. None of it is cheap or easy. Which is why it's taking forever for 4 G to move forward. If I made any technical errors, please excuse me, I'm trying to remember as much as I can from college 11 years ago.", "Awesome question!

{"prompt": "Derivatives in Calculus . In Physics we are using derivatives and I have no clue what 's going on . I 'm a junior in High School and have n't taken Calculus yet . Explain like I'm five.", "human": ["I'm in a car, driving down the highway, and I have a stopwatch. Imagine I don't have a speedometer ( we 'll put it back in in just a moment ), and I want to know how fast I'm going. Well, I could watch the mile markers for an hour, and however many miles I 've traveled would tell me something about how fast I went. Miles traveled / time spent gives us miles per hour, or some sort of speed. But this is an * average speed *. You could imagine I floored it for a while, then got caught in traffic - if I had a speedometer, it'd be changing a lot! Or maybe I had cruise control on - then my speedometer wouldn't change much at all. OK, so how about I only measure how far I go in a minute? Traffic conditions don't change much over just one minute, so I should get a better estimate of my current speed this way: distance traveled/(1/60 of an hour ) = average speed. The distance is shorter ( I'm not going 60 miles! ), but the time is shorter too. But a minute is still lots of time - I could have been going really slow and floored it anyways. So what if I measure how far I go for a second? Or a tenth of a second? Each time, the distance I travel gets shorter, but so does the time involved. And each time I take change in distance divided by change in time to get a speed. And this will be an average speed, but as the time gets shorter, my speed gets less and less likely to change over that time. So over short time periods, my average speed should be really close to what my speedometer would read. A derivative is just taking this whole process to its extreme - you see what happens as the time interval shrinks smaller, and smaller, to the \" limit \" ( the precise meaning of this term isn't important right now ) of zero time. For this case, the speed we get is called my * instantaneous speed *, and it's what my speedometer would show. ( Keeping track of the sign, + for forwards and - for backwards, gives me my * instantaneous velocity *. Velocity is actually the derivative of position, and speed is the absolute value of velocity. ) The thing is that you can also do this procedure for most any function - if I have y = f(x ), then I can find out how much y changes when x changes by a tinier and tinier amount, and for reasonable enough functions f, the change in y over change in x gets closer and closer to a single number which depends on where x \" starts. \" That's called the derivative of y ( or of f ) at wherever x starts. Now this number often depends on where x starts, so I can make a new function called y ' = dy / dx = f'(x ) = df / dx ( lots of different notation, same thing ) which tells me the derivative of y ( or f ) at any given point x. People have gone through some careful work to find the rules for derivatives of some typical functions ( powers, trig functions, logs, exponents, etc ), and you should learn those rules. There are also lots of rules for finding the derivatives of sums, products, quotients, and compositions of functions - you 'll need to learn those also. But always keep in mind our speedometer - less driver.", "Think of the slope of the line y = 2x. the slope is m=2. The derivative of this line would be y=2. since slope is rise / run, slope is the rate of change of the line. Every unit to the right, the line goes up 2 units. Think of a car going 25 mph. the car goes 25 miles, in one hour. the rate of change of this cars distance is 25 mph, or m = 25. The equation for distance would be D = 25h. Those are the simple equations. Now imagine that the car is not moving at a fixed rate. The car is accelerating / decelerating. The Distance graph of this car over time would appear as a curve ( moving a short amount of distance at first, and then more and more ( or less and less ) distance over time. How do you find the slope of a curve? A derivative. there are lots of rules for finding a derivative, depending on the equation, the variables involved, and what is being applied to the variables. Here is the main shortcut you will probably see in a high school physics class. If you are given an equation for distance, then you can derive the equations for velocity and acceleration. Example: D = x^2 + 5x +2 The velocity equation is: V = 2x +5 The variables drop an exponent, and the exponent they have drops down and multiplies ( notice x^2 becomes 2x. 3x^2 would become 6x. If there is just ' x ', the x goes away. ) The constant on the end always disappears as a rule. If you derive one more time from the velocity, you get acceleration. A = 2 Summary: D = x^2 +5x +2 V = 2x + 5 A = 2 You may notice from this that acceleration is A = 2... A constant. If this was the graph of a car moving, the car is constantly accelerating, therefore the velocity has positive slope ( which means the car is going constantly faster, which we already knew ) And the Distance is a quadratic which is a curve, and if you remember algebra, a quadratic with a positive ' a ' out in front means the curve goes upward faster and faster. This isn't for a 5 year old, but that's as simple as I can get it. There are lots of other rules you have to memorize in calculus.

Hence to lose that energy and radiate, Energy quanta transmits as photon. & They continue to exist until there is motion.", "They are generated by the light source. How this happens depends on what type of light it is. Incandescent lamps heat up a piece of metal. Hot things emit light ( called blackbody radiation ). Flourescent lamps run electric current through a gas. The electricity excites the electrons in the gas atoms, which then emit light. LED lamps use a diode. A diode has two chunks of semiconductors stuck together. When electrons move from one chunk to the other, light is released where the joint between them is. The general idea is you 're taking some form of energy, like electricity, and turning it into light energy. > Do they cease to exist if they hit something and aren't reflected? Yep. If they hit something like a piece of black construction paper, they will be absorbed and turned into heat.", "Actual ELI5: You know how when you 're really frustrated you want to scream out and let out some energy? Well, what a light does is make a material ( either a gas, like air, or a solid, like the thing inside old light bulbs ) really really frustrated, and the light \" screams \" by emitting light instead of sound and therefore gives away a bit of it's energy. ELI'm older. Lights work by \" exciting \" a material, whether that be the noble gas inside a fluorescent lamp or a tungsten wire inside an incandescent bulb. When a material is excited, the electrons inside the material move to a higher energy \" orbit \". However, the electrons don't WANT to be in that orbit, they want to be in their home orbit. ( Because they are most \" stable \" there, and the universe, in general, tends toward stability. ) So when they get the chance, they move back down to their home orbit, but do to so they need to give off some energy. ( Because an electron can't arbitrarily move from one level to another, something needs to happen to push it there or something needs to happen to allow it to fall down to a lower level. ) That energy is emitted as a photon ( light ). So what the light has done is convert electricity into photons by a series of chemical / physical processes. The photons are NOT always there. They 're created in the instant the electron moves down to the lower energy level. Remember, photons are massless, they 're just a form of energy, and converting from one energy type to another is easy. EDIT: Oh and yes, photons will \" cease to exist \" if they are absorbed by something else. Essentially in exactly the opposite process. The photon hits the atom at a specific place and makes an electron \" excited. \" Therefore the photon ( which was just energy ) has now become the \" energy \" that is \" exciting \" the electrons. It's like saying \" well if I splash water at a wall the water droplets don't exist after they hit the wall. \" That 's... partially true, but the water DID something to the wall, it made it wet. Same thing with a photon. It DOES something to the atom. So while it doesn't exist AS A PHOTON anymore, it's still there, just in a different form, just like the water on the wall."]}

{"prompt": "What are Arrays , Vectors , and Matrices I just started learning MatLab and I keep hearing these terms used but I do n't know what they are or how they relate to eachother . Please explain like I'm five.", "human": ["As far as programming goes: An array is a way to group multiple values of the same type. Think of a grid ( such as graph paper ). Put a number in each cell. That is a 2D array of numbers ( one dimension is vertical, the other is horizontal ). You can identify each value by its location on the grid ( its x and y coordinates ). You can also identify blocks of values by specifying a range of x and y values. You can have more dimensions than that. A 3D array would be like a Rubik's cube, with each smaller cube holding a single value ( each cube, not square, so that would be 27 values ). You can also have fewer dimensions. An array with a single dimension is called a vector. A line of text is just a vector of letters, for example. And a value with zero dimensions is a scalar. A single number is a scalar. At a more low - level, these arrays are stored in a single large block of memory, in the same layout they appear to you when you view them ( when there are more than one dimensions, the array is \" flattened \" into a vector, with information stored separately on the shape ). This allows modern computers to do calculator very quickly on the whole block of values at once, which is much, much faster than doing then one - at - a - time. This process is called \" vectorization \". So, say you add two arrays of the same shape. This adds together each corresponding value in the two arrays. The computer will do the addition operation on the entire blocks of memory in one go, rather than adding one pair of values then moving on to the next. This is called an \" element - by element operation \". But something like summing all the values is also faster. This is where the difference with matrices comes in. Matrices are a mathematical structure very much like arrays. There are two major differences. First, matrices can not have less than two dimensions. Second, mathematical operations on then are typically not element - by - element. An explanation of matrix math is way outside the scope of this sub, but they have some very useful properties for many more advanced mathematical operations. This matrix math can also be highly accelerated by modern computers. In fact, matrices are really just arrays that do matrix math by default and have been arbitrarily limited to having at least 2 dimensions. But matrices and arrays are really the same thing as far as the computer is concerned, so matrices can do element - by - element operations and arrays can do matrix operations. It is really a decision of the programming language ( or Monday ) how it wants math to work. Now I mentioned that arrays ( and by extension, matrices ). Can hold values of different types. For math, these are typically numbers. But they can also be letters ( that is what text is ) color values ( that is what an image is ), it even references to other values stored elsewhere in memory ( basically the address where you can find another value ). Arrays values all have to have the same type, but by using such references you can fake an array of multiple types ( even other arrays ). The downside is you lose the very fast operations ( because the values you care about are no longer in a single block of memory ). MATLAB calls these \" cell arrays \". MATLAB stands for \" matrix laboratory \". It is really a language built around the matrix. Everything, and I mean everything ( including text ), was a matrix ( they added a couple non - matrix types recently ). This means that math is matrix math by default, although element - by - element operations are possible. This makes many advanced math, science, and engineering calculations easier. It also means all data structures must have at least two dimensions. That means MATLAB has no true vectors or scalars. It tries to fake this by usually, but not always, treating a 2D matrix where one dimension has a length of 1 as a vector, and usually, but not always, treating a 2D matrix where both dimensions have a length of 1 as scalars. So MATLAB talks about \" row vectors \", where the vertical dimension has a length of 1, and \" column vectors \", where the horizontal dimension has a length of 1, but the concept of \" vertical \" and \" horizontal \" are 2D concepts and so don't have any meaning for \" real \" vectors. This can trip people up when the learn MATLAB then try to use another language that does have vectors and scalars ( most other modern languages have vectors and scalars ).", "An easy way to think of them is simply groupings of numbers ( or any objects ) that make sense as a whole group. For a vector example, think about a position in 3d space. you have a position in the x direction, same with the y and z directions. If you were to represent these positions as a whole you would have to group these together into one entity. Hence a \" position \" vector would look like this [ x, y, z ]. An array is very similar to a vector ( to the point where sometimes they are the same thing ), but usually we use them to group very similar numbers / objects together as a sequence of objects / numbers one after another. for example we can have whole numbers between one through ten [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ] A matrix is simply a multidimensional array or vector. if you look at the examples i gave above as if they were a table you can see they are one dimension, 1 row and many columns ( although they can also be 1 column and many rows ). A matrix has multiple rows and multiple columns. e. g [ [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ] [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ] [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ] [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ] [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ] ]", "Arrays are basically ways of organizing numbers in math. So first is the more mathematical concept of arrays, which deals with vectors and matrices: In order to specify a point in say, 3 dimensional space, you need three numbers to say what it's x, y, and z coordinates are, so lets call them ( x, y, z ). If it was 2D space you would only need x and y or something like that. So what are you going to do with these three numbers? Put 'em in a column. Now you have an array of numbers. Often, these numbers will be used to point in a direction, using the origin ( 0, 0, 0 ) as one point, and ( x, y, z ) as the other point. Since only one line can go through two points, that point ( x, y, z ) is pointing you in the direction of the line between itself and the origin. You now have a vector. The big difference between a vector and a regular old number, like 5, is that the vector has a * direction * as well as a magnitude. Now matrices. Say you have a pen laying down on the ground, and you try to balance a playing card on the pen without it touching the ground, probably not gon na happen. If you add another pen which criss - crosses the first, then you can now balance the card on just the pens. Imagine that the pens are lines and the card is a flat surface called a plane. Now you know you need two lines to define a specific plane, which is whatever plane the card was laying in. Remember the vector? Well if you use another, you essentially add a second line and can specify a plane. Put this second vector in a column and pop it to next to the first one. Now you have a matrix! Matrices can be very useful in mathematics for defining numerous objects, and can go much higher than just two columns, but for the purpose of the explanation, I just decided to talk about some basic applications of vectors and matrices in math. Since you mentioned matlab, I feel the need to address arrays in the computational sense: Basically an array is a way of organizing stuff. It is like a big long list, and when you name an array, you can store information in it. Whether it's numbers, words, lots of stuff. You specify where you put a thing in an array by a number, called an index. When you put something in an array, you use the index, for example \" array[3 ] = morestuff \", where 3 is the index, then if you want to see what you put in that spot, you would ask what's in array[3 ], and you would be told that it's morestuff. This is like a table of contents, or like if a list is long or complicated enough that you'd rather just refer to where something is in the list than finding that thing again. Another advantage of arrays is that you can go through everything in one by saying count from 1 to 10 and every time you reach a new number plug it into the index and tell me what's there. Hope that wasn't too convoluted."]}

{"prompt": "How do Islamic Banking give loans for housing purposes?", "human": ["As I understand it, if the \"borrower\" puts a down payment of 20% and the bank puts down 80%, then the bank and the \"borrower\" own the home jointly as tenants in common with a 20%-80% split of the asset amongst them. The \"borrower\" moves into the home and pays the bank 80% of the fair rental value of the home each month. {Material added/changed in edit: For the purposes of illustration, suppose that the \"borrower\" and the bank agree that the fair rental per month is 0. 5% of the purchase cost. The \"borrower\" pays 80% of that amount i. e. 0. 4% of the purchase cost to the bank on a monthly basis. The \"borrower\" is not required to do so but may choose to pay more money than this 0. 4% of the purchase cost each month, or pay some amount in a lump sum. If he does so, he will own a larger percentage of the house, and so future monthly payments will be a smaller fraction of the agreed-upon fair rental per month. So there is an incentive to pay off the bank. } If and when the house is sold, the sale price is divided between \"borrower\" and bank according to the percentage of ownership as of the date of sale. So the bank gets to share in the profits, if any. On the other hand, if the house is sold for less than the original purchase price, then the bank also suffers in the loss. It is not a case of a mortgage being paid off from the proceeds and the home-owner gets whatever is left, or even suffering a loss when the dust has settled; the bank gets only its percentage of the sale price even if this amount is less than what it put up in the first place minus any additional payments made by the \"borrower\". I have no idea how other costs of home ownership (property taxes, insurance, repair and maintenance) or improvements, additions, etc are handled.

Curious why this one is still such a hit , having been out since 2004 . Explain like I'm five.", "human": ["World of Warcraft is one of the first few MMORPG which had a long history and a decent storyline. Avid players of the original warcraft, warcraft 2, 3, and Frozen Throne were ready to dive into a massive world where they could live out their fantasies of revisiting those worlds / maps in the earlier RTS games. The motion control was natural, the quests interesting and most importantly, there was always new content in major patches. With new content, there were new gear to acquire and new bosses to kill. Players were happy to pay for an additional few more months to grind for their fire resistance gear and stuff. That was in 2004. Most other MMORPG games pretty much sucked. With the release of the first expansion, Burning Crusades, the game started to become more casual - friendly. They trivialised battlegrounds ( pvp combat ) by allowing players to gear up at their own pace. They made several important quests / elite mobs much easier to complete. Raids used to consist of 40men. That s 40 dedicated, crazy players who are willing to fork out weekly hours to get a chance at the vaunted purple item which their class needs. I suppose Blizzard must have realised that competition for attention from other MMOs was increasing and the hardcore gamers in Wow were decreasing, so they have been making the game easier and easier ever since. That probably explains why people like me, who have been on this game since 2005, still go back to the game occasionally.

The draw in games like WoW is that they don't \" end \" in the sense that you beat a final boss and the credits roll. In MMORPGs ( massively multiplayer online role - playing games ), not only do you live vicariously through your avatar and interact with other players, but virtually every element of your in - game experience can be enhanced and broadened by leveling up attributes, skills, weapons, etc. , and there's really no end to how far a player can go with this.

{"prompt": "Tax Witholding for Stock Sale", "human": ["I assume US as mhoran_psprep edited, although I'm not sure IRS necessarily means US. (It definitely used to also include Britain's Inland Revenue, but they changed. ) (US) Stockbrokers do not normally withhold on either dividends/interest/distributions or realized capital gains, especially since gains might be reduced or eliminated by later losses. (They can be required to apply backup withholding to dividends and interest; don't ask how I know: -) You are normally required to pay most of your tax during the year, defined as within 10% or $1000 whichever is more, by withholding and/or estimated payments. Thus if the tax on your income including your recent gain will exceed your withholding by 10% and $1000, you should either adjust your withholding or make an estimated payment or some combination, although even if you have a job the last week of December is too late for you to adjust withholding significantly, or even to make a timely estimated payment if 'earlier in the year' means in an earlier quarter as defined for tax (Jan-Mar, Apr-May, June-Aug, Sept-Dec). See https: //www. irs. gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes and for details its link to Publication 505. But a 'safe harbor' may apply since you say this is your first time to have capital gains. If you did not owe any income tax for last year (and were a citizen or resident), or (except very high earners) if you did owe tax and your withholding plus estimated payments this year is enough to pay last year's tax, you are exempt from the Form 2210 penalty and you have until the filing deadline (normally April 15 but this year April 18 due to weekend and holiday) to pay. The latter is likely if your job and therefore payroll income and withholding this year was the same or nearly the same as last year and there was no other big change other than the new capital gain. Also note that gains on investments held more than one year are classified as long-term and taxed at lower rates, which reduces the tax you will owe (all else equal) and thus the payments you need to make. But your wording 'bought and sold... earlier this year' suggests your holding was not long-term, and short-term gains are taxed as 'ordinary' income. Added: if the state you live in has a state income tax similar considerations apply but to smaller amounts. TTBOMK all states tax capital gains (and other investment income, other than interest on exempt bonds), and don't necessarily give the lower rates for long-term gains. And all states I have lived in have 'must have withholding or estimated payments' rules generally similar to the Federal ones, though not identical."]}

Everyone gets treated at the emergency room with all applicable care standards -- always and no matter what. As a practical matter, the vast majority have no payment obligations or relatively small payment obligations. The poor get covered by by a federal / state program called Medicaid. Anyone over 65 -- regardless of wealth or income ( even billionaires ) -- gets covered by a federal program called Medicare. And everyone with private insurance gets covered by private insurance ( subject to whatever deductibles, co - pays, and limitations ). That leaves a small minority who have no coverage -- at least a substantial percentage of whom could afford private health insurance, but chose voluntarily to not get it because of either rational or irrational decison - making. Others couldn't get affordable ( or any ) health insurance coverage because they had pre - existing conditions. Historically, these people would eventually get billed by the hospital. They can easily make reasonable and affordable payment arrangements to pay over time. But, if they can't or won't do this, then the hospital gets substantially or fully reimbursed by federal and state governments. The patient's bill goes to collections. If they have no assets and otherwise can't pay, then nothing really happens, except their credit is ruined. Or they might choose to file for bankruptcy, in which case their credit is ruined, but the debts are discharged. The new 2010 federal healthcare law was allegedly designed to expand the number of poor people covered by Medicaid ( increasing income eligibility to a higher amount ); to prohibit insurers from denying coverage to those with pre - existing conditions; to force all people to buy health insurance if they could afford it ( subsidized if necessary ); and to force everyone to receive and pay for a long list of \" essential \" coverages, whether they need them or not. By the individual mandate, you could prohibit coverage denial for pre - existing conditions. Without the individual mandate, you destroy the entire insurance industry if you also prohibit pre - existing condition denials. So, it's totally silly when you hear so many politicians trying to eliminate the individual mandate while simultaneously swearing to preserve the ban on pre - existing condition coverage denial. It just can't work and it makes no sense. I won't get into the merits, successes, failures, and arguments for and against the new healthcare law. But I think it's safe to say that public opinion is very mixed and probably leans towards disapproval. And that the net economic effect of this multi - thousand - page legislation is that healthcare costs are shifted towards the younger and healthier and away from the older and sicker. Edit -- And just to be clear -- it was illegal as a matter of federal law to deny anyone treatment at the emergency room before the new 2010 federal healthcare law and remains illegal after the new law.", "There's a federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires all hospitals that accept Medicare or Medicaid to treat people at emergency rooms even if they can not pay. Since almost all hospitals accept some form of Medicare or Medicaid, almost no hospital can refuse you emergency treatment. What happens after you get treatment is that the hospital sends you a bill and the debt is treated like any other debt. If you don't pay, the hospital will probably sell the debt to a debt collection agency for a fraction of the price. The debt collection agency will then call or write you asking you to pay. If you do not, they will report it on your credit and eventually sue you. If you respond in court, then you fight the lawsuit. If you do not respond, they will get a default judgment against you and collect whatever \" non - exempt \" assets from you that they can. What is non - exempt varies by state, but usually a creditor can not take your house or car. Whether they can garnish your wages also depends on the state you live in. You are allowed to declare personal bankruptcy to pay off what debts you can and get rid of the rest if you really can't pay, but doing so really hurts your credit. The big issue in America isn't whether hospitals will treat you - they will - it's whether you will have to go bankrupt paying off the bill afterwards. This is also cited as a reason why hospital bills are so high. Hospitals have to treat people, but can't collect payment from a lot of those people, so they pass the costs on to other patients and insurance companies. Edit: Clarified that wage garnishment depends on your state as well."]}

Say you rev your engine to 4000 rpm and take your foot off the gas pedal. If it used the same amount of fuel, you would never slow down to 2000 rpm ( at least without load ).

Some people think this is bad, as teenagers who are feeling the effects of hormones might be influenced to try not to grow up, rebelling against growing up as a person. Another thing that makes people talks a lot about the book is that the people who try to ban it to protect children from it are acting like the main character in his fantasy to protect children. One thing that has made people really be worried about people reading the book is the fact that it has influenced several people who have then tried to, or actually killed other people. One of these was John Lennon, a famous musician; the man who shot him had the book with him when he did it, and called it his statement.

It was \" banned \" and such before Lennon's assassination.

I should note that these instances * really aren't that bad *. Holden doesn't exactly munch clit or anything. He hires a prostitute and chickens out ( I think he tried to have a conversation with her instead... her pimp punches him out ). He flirts with some girls. There's really not much more sexual content than that. I'm thinking it was pretty much a shocking thing for mid - century readers for a book to be first - person narrated by an adolescent so * honestly *. It kinda freaked people out that there was a book that frankly discussed a teenager's sexuality and thoughts towards life. That's just a guess though. There's also a lot of controversy regarding the merit of the novel. It's probably the most hated of the \" classics \". The main criticism is that Holden is unlikable and \" doesn't do anything \". I'm of the opinion that that's kinda the point. He isn't supposed to be an Indiana Jones or anything. It's a coming - of - age novel, and one of the best. He starts out immature, and ends slightly less immature. People have the expectation that it's going to be more like... Trainspotting, or something. Go in with the correct expectations."]}

{"prompt": "Are dividends the only thing linking stocks to corporate performance?", "human": ["There is certainly an obligation in some cases of a company to distribute profit, either as dividend or a stock buy back. Activist investors frequently push for one or the other when a company is doing well - sometimes to the detriment of future growth, in some eyes - and can even file shareholder lawsuits (saying the company is not doing its duty to its shareholders by simply holding onto cash). Apple famously held out from doing either for years under Steve Jobs, and only in the last few years started doing both - a large dividend and a share buy-back which increases the value of remaining shares (as EPS then goes up with fewer shares out there). Carl Icahn for example is one of those investors in Apple's case [and in many cases! ] who put significant pressure, particularly when they were sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars. Ultimately, a (for-profit) corporation's board is tasked with maximizing its shareholder's wealth; as such, it can buy back shares, pay dividends, sell the company, liquidate the company, or expand the company, at its discretion, so long as it can justify to its shareholders that it is still attempting to maximize the value of their holdings. Companies in their growth phase often don't return any money and simply reinvest - but the long-term hope is to either return money in the form of dividends on profits, or the sale of the company."]}

{"prompt": "Why can apes not communicate through human language ? I 'm wondering because apes have a voicebox , tongue , teeth , and a brain that 's near human size . Is it out of the realm of possibility to teach an ape to speak ? Explain like I'm five.", "human": ["I'm not too well versed in the biology of apes, but I'd venture to guess that it's primarily in the physical structure of their vocal tracts. We know that they have the physical capability to make speech sounds because they make noises with their mouth, and we know they have the mental capability to understand language because we can teach it to them. But the primate's vocal tract is shaped differently from the humans. The vocal tract is the area of the head that humans use to shape and manipulate the sound coming out of their mouth, and extends from the front of the lips, up to the nose, and back to the uvula ( the punching bag thing ) and the pharynx behind it. We have decided among ourselves that various shapes mean certain things. The human vocal tract is insanely nuanced and precise because for millenia one of our evolutionary advantages has been the capability of speech, so our vocal tract has become physically refined far more than any other animal. The variety of sounds we are physically capable of making is staggering, and in fact dwarfs the limited notion we have of the alphabet. URL_0 The previous link is the International Phonetic Alphabet which is what speech professionals and linguists have decided are all of the sounds that humans use in languages around the world. It actually excludes sounds not used in languages, so that chart is not even the limit of our speech capabilities. But back to the apes. I would guess that the vocal tract of the ape if much less refined. Their tongues, jaws, lips, soft palates, pharynx, nasal cavities and uvulas are probably much less flexible and agile, meaning that the number of sounds they can shape are fewer. If the apes had their own International Phonetic Alphabet, it would not be as extensive and it would not correspond to ours. It might not be out of the realm of possibility to document the sounds that apes can make and create a language out of those sounds and teach it to them. But For them to learn a human language would, I presume, be biologically impossible. For a quick and similar example, imagine someone who can't roll their r 's. That person is biologically incapable of fully speaking any language with a rolled r. For the apes, almost all of the sounds we use are equivalent to that. They can't do them. The only difference is that any unimpaired human can learn how to roll an r. They have the biological equipment.

When you just * look * at one of them, and don't think about it, you see it like an Ape does. The \" abstraction \" for \" tree \", however, is different - it's an idea.

The brain has deleted every * particular * property and made an abstract category holder which can describe all particular trees - even imagined ones or cartoon ones that don't actually exist.

When someone starts a bank, they normally get together a bunch of investors -- perhaps people they know personally, perhaps they sell stock -- to raise initial capital.

(Banks also borrow money from other banks and from the government. ) They charge the borrowers interest on the loan, and they pay depositors interest on their deposits. The difference between those two interest rates is where the bank gets their profit. Where does the money go when you pay it back?

{"prompt": "ELI15 how a processor works . Like , clock tick , GHz, . Cpu , stuff like that . ELI15 . thanks Explain like I'm five.", "human": ["Several of the simplified explanations already given are pretty good, and since this has been covered quite a few times on ELI5 has well as on many google - able \" simple explanation \" websites, I'm going to take a totally different approach. I'm going to briefly explain * * WHY * * it ended up being done this way. ( in an over - simplified LY5 kind of way ) * Two hundred years ago there were weaving machines ( for cloth ) and then about 120 years ago there were machines used for tallying census data. * Smart people ( Jacquard ) realized the [ complicated patterns on the cloth could be controlled by punching holes in cards ] ( URL_0 ) with one row of holes per row of the weaving. So different cards were used for the * * control * * of the machine to make different patterns. This was around the year 1801. * After watching railroad conductors punch tickets to record fare information, a smart man ( Hollerith ) realized you could also use cards to store * * data * * ( information ) as well. And he built a \" tabulator \" to read the holes ( using relays and solenoids ) and a \" keypunch \" to create patterns in new cards. These were used to tabulate the U. S. Census in 1890, and it finished months ahead of schedule. What an amazing invention! * Now that you had * data * cards, you could build an adding machine, to read a bunch of cards and add them up, and then punch the results into another card. Then you could perhaps feed this card into another machine which had been built to do something with these \" result cards. \" * Hmmm, but why build a new kind of machine for each different kind of thing you wanted to do with a * * data * * card? Ah - hah! You could just make a * generic * machine, and put in a different * * control * * card for each different type of operation you wanted the machine to do. * Meanwhile, people realized that they could build an adding machine or a multiplying machine out of * vacuum tubes * instead of mechanical relays and solenoids. After all, the vacuum tubes could be used more or less just like * really fast * relays. * But these machines were \" programmed \" by plugging different wires into different holes just like the old phone operator switchboards you 've seen in really old movies. Every time you wanted to solve a different equation, a group of people would rearrange the wires so that the machine would do something different. * But wait! What if we used the same trick we did with the cards? Ah - hah! We could have a * * stored program computer * * if we built the \" control card \" into the vacuum tubes, mercury delay lines, and magnetic cores that these tube machines were using to store their data while they calculated on it? * So now we could change the \" program \" by changing the sequence of ones and zeros in the tubes ( just like \" holes \" and \" not holes \" on the cards! ) and we wouldn't have to re - do the wiring each time we wanted to do something different. * Now that the \" program \" was purely stored in electrons, rather than in holes on a control card or in the configuration of wires on a switchboard, we got some extra bonus benefits! Now, we could change up the program on - the - fly. Whoa. And we could loop through one part of the program 17 times, then another part 59 times, then the first part again for 43 times, then we could replace the program entirely in just a few seconds with a completely new one and keep on working on the same data. We could even have the program modify itself! ( OK, that last one eventually turned out to be a really bad idea in some contexts ( weird self - modifying code ), and a really good idea in other contexts ( just - in - time compilers ). But all of that is a story for some other ELI5 post on another day. ) * So now we have a \" stored program computer. \" Everything since then has just been ways to make it do its \" adds and multiplies \" faster and faster. When transistors were invented and became cheap enough, people used them to replace the vacuum tubes, just as the vacuum tubes had replaced the earlier mechanical relays. Then we learned to build chips that had a dozen or so transistors in one chip. So we replaced the big racks of transistors with smaller racks of these chips ( or kept the big racks and just had more \" data storage \" or \" control storage \" in the same amount of space ). The technological improvements continued decade after decade. * * BUT THE GENERAL IDEA STAYED ALMOST UNCHANGED * *. There were still * ones * and * zeroes * that * * controlled * * the machine, and other different ones and zeroes that were the * * data * * being processed by the machine. Just today instead of some mechanical thing clunking through tabulating 5 cards per second with big relays, we have tiny transistors only a few hundred atoms wide clicking on and off a few * billion * times per second. * I left out a lot of details along the way and glossed over a few minor technical matters, but this is ELI5, my post is already huge, and that is the best I can do to summarize 200 years of innovation by several hundred thousand people. If you 're interested, some other important names you can Google are: George Boole, Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, Jacquard, Hollerith, John von Neuman, Konrad Zuse, Alan Turing, John Backus, William Shockley, John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, Robert Noyce, Jack Kilby, Lee de Forest, Federico Faggin, Masatoshi Shima, Ted Hoff, Chris Wallace, Robert Tomasulo, John McCarthy, etc. I'm sure I forgot at least half a dozen extremely important and crucial people in that list. *", "This is one of those questions where if you have to ask, then we probably can't explain it to you well enough. I'm an electrical engineer and it took 4 years of schooling just to get the basic principles understood. NopeSlept did a fairly good job, actually. Basically it boils down to understanding several levels of abstraction. Transistor > Gate > logic > ALU > * many more depending on the architecture *", "Current processors use a binary system to operate. This means that the smallest piece of data available can only have two possible states ( on / off, 0/1, yes / no, electricity / no electricity ). Eight of these ' bits ' of data make a byte. This is the way data is formatted for a processor to use. A [ Transistor ] ( URL_1 ) is an electrical component that handles binary operations. It's a switch that is contoled by the bits of data, and in turn controls subsequent bits of data. Processors are made of billions of these switches, and handles huge amounts of data quickly enough for you to run complex applications. The transistors are connected very specifically, and in a sort of heiracy. Transistors can be arranged in a certain way to create things like [ Logic Gates ] ( URL_3 ). Logic Gates can be arranged in a certain way to create things like [ Muliplexers ] ( URL_2 ). Multiplexers and Logic Gates can be arranged in a certain way to create things like [ Arithmetic Logic Units ( ALU ) ] ( URL_0 ). It's not important what these all mean; just understand that each combination gives more advance data handling and decision making. This is just the start. Bigger and more advanced components combine to handle data effectively. It helps to abstract different operational layers, and only view one at a time. If you ever tried to visualize a processor's entire operation on the transistor level you'd need to have a little cry. To answer your example in the OP: A clock is found in synchronous logic. This is when it's important to keep a rythm so that data passes through the right places at the right time, and when the data comes out the end, it's in line with all the other data it's expecting. Asynchronous logic does not use a clock. GHz is a frequency, or ' actions per second '. The higher the frequency, the faster the processor ' thinks '. However, processor frequency or clock speed is not the only factor determining how good a processor is. CPU stands for [ Central Processing Unit ] ( URL_4 ). In your home computer, it will be the main processor.

In general though, much like with margin calls, you should avoid being in the position where the broker needs to (or can do) anything with your account. As a quick aside: I can't think of a scenario where you wouldn't be able to sell your options, but you probably are aware of the huge spreads that exist for many illiquid options.

Splitting the big payment in parts means that the seller gets money in parts as well, and it adds risks of customer default, introduces debt collection possibility etc. That's why it's usually up to the merchants to support it - bank does not care in this case, from the bank point of view the store just charges the same card another $250 every month. In other countries banks support this option directly, I think, taking over or dividing the risk with the merchants. This has not happened in US.

Here is a simple article describing how credit cards work: https: //www. usbank. com/credit-cards/how-credit-cards-work. html In general, if you move to US, you are unlikely to be able to get a regular credit card because you will not have any \"credit history\" which is a system designed to track each customer ability to get & pay off debt. The easiest way to build the history - request \"secured credit card\", which means you have to give the bank money up front and then they will give you a credit card with a credit limit equal to that amount. It's like a \"practice credit card\". You use it for 6-12 months and the bank will report your usage to credit bureaus, establishing your \"credit score\". After that you should be able to get your money back and convert your secured card into a regular credit card. Credit history can be also built by paying rent and utilities but that requires companies who collect money to report the payments to credit bureaus and very few do that.

But it's not always the same amount of chocolate chips; sometimes you get a lot, sometimes you only get a few. Let's say on average you get five chocolate chips in every bite you take. Now if the person who made the cookie mixed up the dough really really well, so the chocolate chips were fairly evenly distributed in the cookie, you would usually get pretty close to 5 chocolate chips per bite. Sure sometimes you might get only 4, or maybe you get 6, but getting more than 7 in one bite would be pretty rare. But what if they didn't mix up the dough very well, so there are big clusters of chocolate chips in some parts of the cookie, and other parts where there are almost no chocolate chips at all. Then you might get one bite with 10 chocolate chips in it, and your next bite might only have 1. In both cases, your average chocolate chips per bite would still be 5, but in the second case, you would expect a wider range of chocolate chips per bite. If you can expect to get a number that is pretty close to the average when you take a bite, we would say that cookie has a low * standard deviation *. On the other hand, the unmixed cookie has a relatively high standard deviation. So standard deviation is just a way to say how close you can expect the number of chocolate chips you get in a bite to be to the average.", "Let's say you wanted to measure America's height. You will get some very short people, some very tall people, and many that are considered ' average ' height. Your standard deviation tells you how far apart your measurements are.

The chain stays the same size and so does the second gear the chain is attached to that doesn't have varying sizes to change to. When you switch to a higher gear, each complete turn of the pedal results in a more complete turn of the second, non - changing, gear. When using a lower gear, the same amount of distance the pedal travels results in a less complete rotation of the second ( again - non moving ) gear. So as to why it is more difficult on higher gears, well you are travelling the same distance with the pedals in rotation but due to gear size, it is rotating that second gear much more, therefore there is more energy required to do so."]}

This group of 50 governments is managed by a FEDERAL government. Let's say you 're in elementary school and on the playground there are many gangs of little 7 year - olds. Each gang has it's own rules and code and style. However, to keep the gangs working together on the playground, the playground needs to be managed by a teacher. If the teacher was part of one of the gangs and bound by its rules, it wouldn't be fair for everyone else. By analogy, this is why the Federal capital ( Washington DC ) is not in any state, it needs to be \" impartial \" and it's the Constitution ( the \" rules of the playground \", if you will ) that say this. The Electoral College is how the states vote for new president which the Federal capital government should have a say in. However the Congress is the state's ways of changing or adding laws. Seeing as in the law - making - and - deciding process, the Federal capital is \" represented \" by the President, it doesn't have a place in the Congress too. I dunno exactly though, that's how I'd justify it though my way of putting it is certainly not a perfect argument ( and nor is the US a perfect system of government ).", "The Constitution. Article 1 of the US constitution outlines voting rights for Congress. Among other things, it says that only states are represented in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The District of Columbia is not a state... ergo it does not get to vote in Congress. Under Congressional rules ( not the constitution ), DC gets a non - voting \" delegate \" ( NOT a Senator or Representative ) who can vote in committee and participate in floor debate, but who can not vote on any legislation. Article 1 also permitted the establishment of a district * ceded * by state(s ) to be the seat of government, i. e. the capital city. Virginia & Maryland ceded the land that became the District of Columbia. This put the land under the control of Congress. The portion ceded by Virginia ( mostly Arlington & Alexandria, VA ) was returned to that state in 1846. In other words, all of present - day DC was donated by Maryland. This has the effect of making the national capital sort of an unorganized incorporated territory. The residents are not residents of any state but rather under the direct control of Congress - which, being made of up representatives of the states, has never cared that much. In 1961, the 23rd amendment was passed & ratified, giving DC the same number of votes in the electoral college as the state with the fewest number of votes ( currently three votes. ) This is why DC residents can vote in presidential elections. In 1973, Congress passed the home rule act, delegating many municipal functions to a city government while retaining ultimate veto power over any DC action.

{"prompt": "Ayn Rands Philosophy and why it 's frowned upon I have read The Fountainhead and I really enjoyed it . Also , I think her points were pretty good but maybe I did n't get it . Explain like I'm five. ", "human": ["It attracted me as a high school student. I was an angst - ridden valedictorian who found myself validated by her characters. When I went to college and studied philosophy and religion more in depth, I quickly abandoned her ideas. She's fun to read but lacks the depth of other philosophers, and her philosophy has some gaping holes in it. A few examples of why philosophers typically ignore her: * Her philosophy only touches on politics and ethics but ignores the essential building blocks that most others use to get there: her system is fun but intellectually shallow. For instance, Kant offers ethics and political ideas like Ayn Rand, but he also overturns how we understand understanding itself in his \" Critique of Pure Reason \". Kant gets you to ethics by pointing out the difficulty of understanding things - as - they - are - in - themselves ( his work on this is a real mindfuck when you get deep into it ), whereas Ayn gets you there by saying \" Wouldn't it be nice if people were fully and only rational and self - serving? \" Her system is weaker because her foundations are less basic, less primal, and rely on shallower foundations than others. * Ayn Rand's ideas require perfectly rational and philosophically consistent people, and those don't exist. It's why pure communism fails beyond the small scale. All people are imperfect humans and make dumb, irrational decisions. The first Bioshock video game even offers an Ayn Randian dystopia, where everything goes horribly awry because ( surprise ), people aren't truly rational and ethically consistent. * Ayn Rand's system does little to overcome the [ tragedy of the commons ] ( URL_0 ), which is a major problem of politics and economics. Her system fails because she incorrectly assumes rational self - interest will sort out all problems, but the tragedy of the commons is all about situations and times when rational self - interest is leads to undesirable outcomes or even self - destruction. Her system by - and - large can not overcome this existential problem that faces every community in the long run. * She largely rejects government welfare programs as mooching, but that's more her ex - Soviet background speaking than anything else. The majority of homeless people in my home county were there due to unforeseeable medical emergencies but were previously major assets to the community. Under Rand's system, too bad so sad: get a loan, hope someone's self - interest leads them to be charitable, or die in the streets. Under a good social safety net, you hit a rough patch, are freely supported for a bit by the community, and then return to normal life and contributing to society. Also, think about this: robots have replaced factory workers, are slowly replacing drivers and accountants, and are close to outsmarting human doctors now too. Under Rand's system, the advancement of robotics would leave the vast majority of humans destitute, leading to civil unrest and wars, which again is unhealthy and unhelpful for a functioning human society. * Ayn Rand's novels celebrate geniuses who would succeed in fair competitions, but even if there were no governments, Howard Roark and friends could still be stomped by unscrupulous corporations. Life and people aren't fair: humans are not only often dumb and inconsistent but also major jerks. Nikolai Tesla was arguably smarter than and had the better electricity system compared to Thomas Edison, but Edison manipulated people to try to discredit and destroy the superior electricity system. The oil barons of the early 1900s did even crazier things to destroy their rivals, and they did a lot of it purely on their own by manipulating market forces and people's self - interest, no governments necessary. Now rather than rival inventors or old - timey oil barons, imagine you start up a brilliant new website in a world where no government exists to defend net neutrality. Comcast would steal your idea and restrict traffic to your website until you gave up, sold the rights to them for cheap, and went home broke. People are dicks and abuse their power, with or without government intervention, and again, Ayn Rand's system fails to prevent Comcast from dicking you and your startup company over. * EDIT: Stealing from the stack - exchange post, which is one of the best replies here, Rand also doesn't meet the philosophical standards of today's two major intellectual camps. Analytic philosophy prefers \" If A and B, then C unless D \" kinds of discussions of very specific questions, while the Continental school favors broader and more comprehensive / holistic discussions ( I'm really weak with Continental philosophy, so I can't explain it well ). She doesn't do either Analytic or Continental well and doesn't fully engage with other philosophers in a real way, mostly because she primarily advocates her ideas via stories and proverbs rather than via full and honest argumentation against rival philosophers. * There are certainly more problems with her philosophy than listed here, and it's been years since I 've read her books, so I may have a few things wrong here. The crux of my objections is that her books are a fun read but not really that intellectually sustainable when you start stacking her up against other philosophers. My advice? Go read Plato's \" Republic \", Aristotle's \" Nicomachaen Ethics \", Adam Smith's utilitarian ethics, Kant's deontological ethics, Reinhold Niebuhr's \" Moral Man, Immoral Society \", some modern analytic philosophy essays, and a few other big - name philosophers of your choice for good measure. Then you 'll probably start to see why Ayn Rand is looked down upon.", "Ayn Rand's views are completely contrary to my own ( personally I think she was a sociopath ), but I 've read The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. I enjoyed the Fountainhead as well, despite my political views, simply because it's a good story with fairly compelling characters. Atlas Shrugged is more of a manifesto on her philosophy, which is essentially just pure selfishness. She believes that altruism, i. e. helping others, is evil. And that the only moral thing a person can do is care only for their own desires. It's frowned upon because that's the opinion of, at best, a very unpleasant person, and at worst, a dangerous psychopath. Atlas Shrugged is much more unabashed in displaying this ideology, so you should read that too to understand why she is frowned upon, because The Fountainhead isn't quite as... aggressive.", "I was drawn in by the Fountainhead as well when I was 18 or 19. It makes basic sense the idea that each person should just take care of themselves and everyone would be fine. About a year after I read the Fountainhead I read Atlas shrugged. Longer story but same basic principles apply. As I became an adult I began to get some cognitive dissonance over some of the things that we practiced and preached in there. Probably the biggest problem I have with her philosophy now is that it assumes that a free - market will allow the good businesses to drown out or quash the bad businesses or the cheating businesses. Reality is far from that. In fact it's quite the opposite. The cheating bad business collude to drown out the good players. You 're left with fixed markets in little choice for the consumers. Also I began to realize that it's actually smart for society as a whole to put aside some money to take care of those that need help for example Health insurance. And the older I got the more I realized that we are not just a bunch of individuals. While we are all unique we also all share a common thread. We don't only need to act individually but also as a collective for the betterment of all of us. It didn't help that I found out that Ayn Rand happily accepted social security benefits. Also, to understand how she came up with these concepts that helps to understand where she came from. She came from pre - Revolution in Russia. Unlike most people, her family was doing very well under czarist Russia. The Russian revolution happened when she was a young girl and her family fled Russia. Understandably she was affected by this and it came to shape her reasoning. If you study her at all you 'll find out that she seemingly had some pretty major issues. If you were going to be on her team or on her side you had to agree with her on everything if you disagreed over even the smallest point you were out. Lastly, finding out she idolized serial killer William Edward Hickman did it for me. I realized she was really just a woman with some problems with a world view shaped by her childhood. Also, as I got older I realized the guys that idolized her are so often know - it - all guys that so very often have little or no experience with women or raising kids but claim to know how everyone should be. Turns out I'm just too compassionate and close to normal to remain a Rand - er. URL_0"]}

If you had a ruler that was 7 cm long, and you placed a 1 gram weight at the 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, and 7 cm marks, then you could balance the ruler on your finger if you put it at 2. 43 cm.", "One way of looking at it: it like taking everything and redistributing it evenly. If a bunch of people in a room take their cash, combine it, then give everyone an equal amount of the total, the amount they would get is the average. Now, of someone came with 5 grand and someone else came with 5 cents, you can see that some would loose a lot of money, and some would gain a lot. The farther you are from the average, the bigger the difference. This means that in some cases, taking the regular average of the data doesn't give a good picture of the situation. If most of the values are close together, then the average is a way of boiling down a large amount of data into one number, making it easier to understand quickly. If I see that one teacher's average test score is 90 and another's is 60, it's probably a safe bet that there is some big difference between their classrooms. This doesn't mean that the highest score is in the first one, however, it just means that all together, most students in the 90 % room are doing better."]}

When I borrow money from a bank, a contract is signed that says. If it's a mortgage contract, it might say, I 'll pay $ 1000 a month for 30 years. Now, you pay the bank back. But, the bank can sell that contract. And, if they do, you have to pay the new owner of that contract. So, you were paying Bank of America, and they sell it to Wells Fargo, you now have to pay Wells Fargo. Now, when big business borrow money, they can't just go to a bank. No one person or bank is going to lend GM $ 1 Billion Dollars. So, GM issues bonds. If GM wants to raise $ 1B, they might sell 1 Million $ 1000 bonds. Now, each bond is a contract, that says, if you buy this bond for $ 1 K, I 'll give you $ 1200 back in 3 years. You and I can buy and sell those bonds to and from other people. Now, even if you don't buy bonds directly, most of us have a 401 K plan. And, that 401 K is invested in mutual funds. Those mutual funds often buy and sell bonds as part of their investment. So, it's quite possible that you might owe Wells Fargo $ 300 K for your mortgage, but though your 401 K, you might hold $ 10 K worth of Wells Fargo bonds. Wells Fargo owes you $ 10K. You both owe each other. The same thing happens on a bigger scale with governments. Like companies, they issue bonds, that are bought and sold. We all know the US has a lot of debt ( ~$16 T trillion ), and we all know that China owns a lot of it, about $ 1. 2 trillion. But, what a lot of people don't know, is that China has a lot of debt too. In fact, China's national debt is over $ 2 trillion. So, China owes more to other people, than we owe to China. For a 5 year old, it might seem kinda silly for a country to hold debt of another country, when they owe money. But there are reasons for it. In fact, the US holds debt of other countries. The US holds about $ 6 T in foreign debt. Most of that is from the UK, but we actually hold some of China's debt too, go figure. See, everyone is holding everyone else debt. Now, let's look at the US debt for a second. We owe about ~$16T. Now, US government held just under $ 5 T of that ( Yes, the federal gov't owes money to itself... wtf, I know ), and the public ( people, companies, other countries ) held the remaining ~$11T. Of that $ 11 T, $ 5. 3 T was foreign held. If you 're following the numbers, other countries owe the US more ( $ 6 T ) than we other other countries ( $ 5. 3 T ).

", "human": ["I own quite a few properties used solely for investment. First off, you make money by charging tenants ( renters ) for living in your house. Depending on the terms, the rent can cover utilities or the utilities can be payed by the tenant every month / week / fortnight. To start, all you need is a property that let's you rent to tenants. If it's an apartment, most management ( body corporate ) will limit the tenants you 're allowed to have to a certain number; however, if it's a house, it's up to your discretion. To get started, first, of course, get a unit ( property ) under your name. Next, speak to a lawyer about drafting a tenancy agreement - this will legally bind your tenants to the rules you set out for them for renting. After that, list your property with an agent or online to find tenants. If you are renting the unit yourself and want to rent out a room ( or the entire unit ) then it's called subletting. You 'll need to check with your landlord and look at your tenancy agreement to see if this is allowed. Tips: 1 ) If you own the unit but are still paying mortgage, try to make the amount you rent the property for equivalent or greater than your monthly payments to the bank, that way you 'll basically be buying the house for how much your down - payment was and possibly making profit. 2 ) It's always easier if you 're in the country or area where you 're managing the properties. I move around quite a bit so I have a agent help me out when needed. 3 ) Don't skimp on the legal fees for tenancy agreement contracts, a solid contract could save you a lot of time, effort, and money in the future. 4 ) Talk to your tenants before agreeing to let them rent. Knowing that your unit is in good hands in always comforting. If you have any more questions just pm me or reply to this message! Hope this helps!", "Depends on house price vs rental potential as to how easily you can make money. We started by simply not selling our old house when we bought a new one. We maintained two mortgages instead and rented one property. We then slowly built up enough funds for further properties until we had five total. We have since scaled back to three but our own home is now entirely debt free. I would say that house rental is not as profitable as renting a flat / apartment. Our original house rental yielded virtually no profit. Flats on the other hand are fantastic. Also easier to maintain. Biggest profit though is in appreciation of property price - so choose your location carefully.", "We were very poor when I changed careers. Some friends of ours sold their house to us as a rent - to - own. That means we didn't have to put down a down payment. The house went up in value, so 10 years later we took out a mortgage on the house and bought a 3 unit house. We had to put 20 % of the value of the house down and then the bank loaned us the rest of the money for the house. We have to pay the band every month for the mortgage, and we also pay property taxes and fire insurance. We also have to pay for repairs. One of the renters we inherited caused about $ 9, 000 in damage to the house, so that was painful. We decided to be very careful who we rented to. But I also wanted to get as much rent as possible from the apartments because we were sometimes losing money. Rent is similar to an auction. At an auction you just bid for the item until it gets too high for what you want to pay for it, and then you stop bidding. The highest bidder gets the item. Rent is the same way. Landlords look around at what other landlords are getting for rent, and then they ask for the same or a little more. If there are no applicants, they lower the rent. If there are a lot of applicants, they raise the rent. Now that we have owned our property for 10 years, now we are getting about one quarter of the money we collect from rent as take home for us. There is one other way to become a landlord: There are agencies in our town ( Called Land Trusts ) that loan out the down payment for a house, and they own 20 % of your house until you sell it. Then they get 20 % of the sales price. That is a way to go from renting to owning. I would suggest you start as soon as possible!"]}

The same thing happens with oil. If all the oil is together in one big puddle it will burn slowly. Splashing the oil around will only make the oil burn faster. Now, burning oil is very hot. Much hotter than boiling water. When you pour water in burning oil, the oil is so hot that it makes the water boil all at once and turn into steam. This steam splashes the oil up and out of the pan, which makes the oil burn very fast and flare up.", "Well, part of it is just that water displaces grease instead of mixing with it, so the result is that it splashes grease everywhere instead of putting out the fire. In addition to that, the water turns into vapor from the heat of the fire, and expands rapidly, slinging more grease outwards in smaller particles. Being divided into smaller particles increases the surface area of the grease, allowing it to burn a lot faster. This results in a far larger flame."]}

{"prompt": "Please explain what is \"Lebesgue integration\"", "human": ["In mathematics, the integral of a non-negative function of a single variable can be regarded, in the simplest case, as the area between the graph of that function and the x-axis. The Lebesgue integral, named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, extends the integral to a larger class of functions. It also extends the domains on which these functions can be defined. Long before the 20th century, mathematicians already understood that for non-negative functions with a smooth enough graph—such as continuous functions on closed bounded intervals—the area under the curve could be defined as the integral, and computed using approximation techniques on the region by polygons. However, as the need to consider more irregular functions arose—e. g. , as a result of the limiting processes of mathematical analysis and the mathematical theory of probability—it became clear that more careful approximation techniques were needed to define a suitable integral. Also, one might wish to integrate on spaces more general than the real line. The Lebesgue integral provides the necessary abstractions for this. The Lebesgue integral plays an important role in probability theory, real analysis, and many other fields in mathematics. It is named after Henri Lebesgue (1875–1941), who introduced the integral (Lebesgue 1904). It is also a pivotal part of the axiomatic theory of probability. The term Lebesgue integration can mean either the general theory of integration of a function with respect to a general measure, as introduced by Lebesgue, or the specific case of integration of a function defined on a sub-domain of the real line with respect to the Lebesgue measure."]}

I 've heard numerous times that water isn't compressible, so wouldn't make a good hydraulic fluid on aircraft, while the red petroleum based fluid we used did. I never could wrap my brain around that.", "Water is compressible, just not really until very high pressures. In thermodynamics, you can approximate a liquid to be non - compressible until super high pressures to make life easier. This approximation does break down, though. Fluids that are thought of as \" compressible \" are gasses, and it's because in their state of matter, they are fairly spaced out as they just whizz through space. Because of this space between them, changing the pressure has a relatively drastic change in volume because the intermolecular forces aren't acting very strongly. Contrasting this with both liquids and solids, the distance between the molecules is much lower, and intermolecular forces play a larger role. Atoms don't like to be too close together, requiring more pressure to change the volume. The most ideal hydraulic working fluid has zero compressibility, but this isn't a property that any matter has. Having virtually zero compressibility - as is the case with water and petroleum based fluid - lends them to direct force effectively from one side to another. You can see this effect [ here ] ( URL_0 ) - the bulk modulus. This is the relationship between how much a pressure increase will decrease volume. As listed, gasses have a low value, liquids being a few orders of magnitude higher, and solids being even higher.", "Gases are compressible because the molecules have a lot of empty space in between. If you push on a molecule, it has a lot of empty space to move into. So it is easy to compress the gas. In a liquid, the molecules are almost touching. ( Molecules don't really have well - enough - defined boundaries to \" touch \", but it's OK to think of them that way to a first approximation. ) There is a little bit of space, but not much. So when you push on one water molecule, the neighboring molecules push back on it, and their neighbors push back on them, and so on, making liquid water much harder to compress than a gas."]}
{"prompt": "To sell or to rent the house?", "human": ["So either scenario has about $10K upfront costs (either realtor/selling expenses or fixing up for rental).

You end up with 2. 7% ROI, which is not a lot for a rental. The rule of thumb your wife mentioned (1% of cash equity) is indeed usually for ROI of leveraged rental purchase. However, if rental prices in your area are rising, as it sounds like they are, you may end up there quite soon anyway. The downside is that the money is locked in.

People flying from Phoenix to Boise all have a final destination of Boise. * * Second Part: * * Now, in order to address why planes are so full. There are two types of people to fly on a plane. In aviation terms, positive space or non - rev customers. Positive space customers are like you - people who pay for an airplane ticket. Non - rev customers are people who work for the airlines that fly for free, but can only board a plane if there is space available ( Non - rev = non - revenue ).

In the 1970s, the term \"GPU\" originally stood for graphics processor unit and described a programmable processing unit independently working from the CPU and responsible for graphics manipulation and output. Later, in 1994, Sony used the term (now standing for graphics processing unit) in reference to the PlayStation console's Toshiba-designed Sony GPU in 1994. The term was popularized by Nvidia in 1999, who marketed the GeForce 256 as \"the world's first GPU\".

Nowadays it might seem silly, but that was the notion at that time. Francesco Redi didn't believe this. He believed that fly maggots come from other fly maggots and there's no way they can't come out of nowhere. To prove this he set a simple experiment: He had three jars -A, B, and C-, each with a piece of meat inside. Jar A was completely open ( didn't have a lid ), jar B was only covered with a fine cloth, jar C was completely closed with a lid. After leaving the jars alone for a few days he got the following results: * the meat in the open jar was full of maggots and there were adult flies surrounding eat * the meat in the jar with the cloth was untouched * but * there were maggots over the cloth and some adult flies surrounding it * the meat in the closed jar was untouched and there were no maggots or flies around It proved that maggots ( and to some extent, life ) doesn't come out of nowhere, rather it's a link of reproductive events.

When trained on a set of examples without supervision, a DBN can learn to probabilistically reconstruct its inputs. The layers then act as feature detectors. After this learning step, a DBN can be further trained with supervision to perform classification. DBNs can be viewed as a composition of simple, unsupervised networks such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) or autoencoders, where each sub-network's hidden layer serves as the visible layer for the next. An RBM is an undirected, generative energy-based model with a \"visible\" input layer and a hidden layer and connections between but not within layers. This composition leads to a fast, layer-by-layer unsupervised training procedure, where contrastive divergence is applied to each sub-network in turn, starting from the \"lowest\" pair of layers (the lowest visible layer is a training set). The observation that DBNs can be trained greedily, one layer at a time, led to one of the first effective deep learning algorithms. :  6  Overall, there are many attractive implementations and uses of DBNs in real-life applications and scenarios (e. g. , electroencephalography, drug discovery)."]}

When you see engine RPMs, this is revolutions per minute - the speed with which this shaft is rotating. If the drive shaft is hooked directly up to a wheel, that is a single speed transmission. The wheel will turn at whatever speed the engine is turning over. Gasoline engines are powered by pistons and cylinders. ( Detailed description: URL_1 ). The faster the pistons are firing and the faster the engine is turning over, they higher the physical stresses on the engine components. Your typical car maxes out at 6000 - 7000 RPMs, after which you risk damage to the little bits that connect the cylinders to the drive shaft. Stronger components can allow the engines to turn over more rapidly. Some race cars limit is more like 13, 000 RPMs, but at some point if you want to go faster you need to reduce the speed with which the engine rotates. This is accomplished by changing the gear, which changes the ratio between engine and wheel rotation so that the engine can remain within it's operating range and the wheels can spin at the speed with which the vehicle is moving. Gas engines are also more efficient at lower RPMs, and produce more power at high RPMs, so you need some way to alter the RPMs of the engine depending on what you need the car to do. If you 're travelling at a constant 50 mph, you want your engine to be turning at something like 1500 RPMs ( the most efficient speed will vary based on the engine and vehicle ). If you want to speed up to 70 mph to pass, you need the engine to be able to be running at 4000 RPMs at 50 mph to accelerate quickly. Thus, gears. Electric engines have no pistons. They ( usually ) have a single moving part which is turned by using a magnet inside an electric field. As the electric field is rotated, the magnet turns to align with the field. The speed with which the engine can turn only limited by the speed with which the magnet can rotate. Electric engines also produce almost the same power and torque at almost any RPM.

{"prompt": "What is the difference in mechanism between bluetooth and wifi ? Understanding that both are able to transmit information wirelessly , what is the distinct difference between these two ? Please explain like I'm five.", "human": ["One difference is that Wifi typically sticks to one frequency channel. Bluetooth uses channel hopping, which is used to increase its resilience to interference. Not really ELI5 though, sorry: p", "Bluetooth is shorter range and lower power, and is host - device based. It's like usb without wires. Wifi is like Ethernet without wires.", "On a very low level they are basically the same. They use electromagnetic waves in specific frequencies to transmit data by modulating those waves. In modern cases, there is little inference between those two, as bluetooth generally still uses the 2. 4ghz band while modern Wi - Fi signals use the 5ghz band. Wi - Fi connections using the old g / b standards are also sending on the 2. 4ghz band. For Bluetooth this is 2400mhz to 2483. 5mhz. The first 2mhz and the last 3. 5mhz are a guard band. The closer two different signals are at the same frequency, the more likely it becomes that they interfere with eachother. Having some space at the bottom and top of the standard frequency used spaces different signals a bit out. After that it uses alot of 1mhz channels for transmitting data, trying to find some that is free. Should be ~80 channels. The bigger the channel band, the more data you can modulate into it, so bigger bands often means higher transfer rates. At the same time, bigger channel bands also mean more sources can interfere with the data ( as it is more likely that a random signal has the same frequency ). So, with many 1mhz channels you can not transmit data ultra fast, but you can have many devices in a small area ( imagine a heavy traffic and many people with bluetooth headsets in their cars in a relative small area ). Basically anyone can have their own wireless personal area network ( short WPAN ). Bluetooth als sends with much less power reduces the range of each individual signal ( again, personal area ). Modern Wi - Fi on the other hand not only uses another band alltogether, the channels can be, and often are much bigger. The Wi - Fi ac standard can handle channels with 160mhz bandwidth. This allows for much higher transferspeeds, but lowers the amount of different channels possible. After those hardware side differences, there are also differences at how the operating system handles connections on the different connection methods. As bluetooth is used for many devices with specific purpose, like headsets, speakers, keyboards, mice, remotes etc. the bluetooth standard defines a way for those single purpose devices to tell the system they are connected to, what kind of device they are and what services they offer ( like a headset tells the system that it can playback sound and record audio, while a keyboard tells the system that it can take keyinput from the user ). Wi - Fi connections are rather seen as 2 equal devices that communicate with each other instead of one offering a service to another. So they just define that both should now general networking. And then have specific programs on each side actually doing stuff over the network."]}
{"prompt": "How does the \" shuffle \" feature on my iPod work ? Sometimes I get chunks of songs from the same artists or same albums too . Does this have something to do with how the shuffle works ? Explain like I'm five.", "human": ["If it's actually shuffle, it should just be random. However, just because it's random doesn't mean you won't get chunks of songs from the same artists / albums. Actually it means the opposite. I won't go into the math behind this, but statisticians sometimes do what's called a runs test to figure out if a set of data is random or not. Take for example a situation where someone claims to have flipped a coin 100 times, and wrote down the results. If he didn't flip the same side twice in a row anywhere in those 100 times, it's likely he's lying and just wrote down the numbers systematically, without flipping any coin. It's just as likely as if he had written down 50 heads in a row, then 50 tails. The same holds true for the shuffle feature on an iPod. Getting the same artist several times in a row every so often is actually evidence that it * is * truly random. Now, one more point, something called confirmation bias. It might seem like you get the same artist a lot more often than you should, but this is because that's what's called an event, while when it works properly it's a non - event, because that's just normal operation. The human brain is wired to recognize and distinctly remember events, while non - events aren't even noticed, let alone remembered.

The big safety concern for cooking meat to well are bacteria and parasites which may on or in the flesh. In the not so distant past, the US has experienced problems with salmonella bacteria in poultry and trichinosis parasites in pork. These both led to public health campaigns to encourage cooking these meats to a temperature which kills these organisms. Beef is suceptable to several pathogens and people can and do get ill from under - cooked beef products, but public resistance to changing their beef cooking habits has been stronger than for these other meat products.", "As mentioned elsewhere, it all has to do with pathogens. When raised, slaughtered, and prepared in clean, safe conditions meat from practically any animal can safely be eaten raw. This always carries some risk, but not much. Raising animals in unclean environments can lead to things like trichinosis infecting pork meat and salmonella infecting your chickens. Additionally, it is believed that modern cow diets ( high in corn ) increase the amount of e coli in their gut. Next you have slaughtering. When you slaughter an animal, there's always some risk that the meat will come into contact with something you don't want - this is what happens with beef. Beef gets contaminated with e coli when the meat is exposed to the cow's gut and, yes, feces somehow. However, that generally only spreads along the surface of the meat and does not contaminate the interior. That's why it's ok to serve a steak rare, but when you grind it up and serve it as a hamburger it's best to cook it through. Finally, there's preparation - cross contamination from other affected meat, kitchen bacteria, mold, etc. can all infect an otherwise pristine piece of meat. Also, due to the extremely low prevalence of trichinosis in modern pigs, the FDA has lowered the recommended cooking temp of pork - it's ok to serve it a little pink!", "You don't NEED to. The overwhelming, vast majority of pork is NOT infected with tapeworm, but a few scares over the years have caused the FDA to say * \" You need to cook the SHIT out of your pork or you 'll end up like John Hurt! \" * As to chicken, the conditions in which most broilers ( eatin ' chickens, as opposed to egg chickens, known as \" layers \" ) are raised and slaughtered are so unbelievably filthy that the meat coming out of the packing plant does sometimes carry salmonella. If the farmer is conscientious about the conditions his animals are raised in, however, there's very little risk, and there are a few adventurous restaurants out there serving pork and chicken sashimi from local ranchers. It turns out that, surprise! , happy healthy animals produce healthful, nutritious meat. Grass - fed, range - raised beef, for instance, contains more omega-3 fatty acids than most fish."]}

{"prompt": "Please explain what is \"The Matrix\"", "human": ["The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis. [a] It is the first installment in The Matrix film series, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano, and depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside the Matrix, a simulated reality that intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias \"Neo\", uncovers the truth, he joins a rebellion against the machines along with other people who have been freed from the Matrix. The Matrix is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes was influenced by Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions. The film popularized a visual effect known as \"bullet time\", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed, allowing the sped-up movements of certain characters to be perceived normally. The Matrix opened in theaters in the United States on March 31, 1999, to widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value, [10][11] and was a massive success at the box office, grossing over $460 million on a $63 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of 1999 and the fourth highest-grossing film of that year. At the 72nd Academy Awards, the film won all four categories it was nominated for, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, and Best Sound Editing. The film was also the recipient of numerous other accolades, including Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects at the 53rd British Academy Film Awards, and the Wachowskis were awarded Best Director and Best Science Fiction Film at the 26th Saturn Awards. The film is considered to be among the greatest science fiction films of all time, [12][13][14] and in 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant. \"[15]The film's success led to two feature film sequels being released in 2003, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, which were also written and directed by the Wachowskis. The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films.

{"prompt": "College Football Realignment Why are teams switching conferences ? Why could n't things stay the same ? Explain like I'm five.", "human": ["Main reasons: 1. TV Money - The Pac-10 had average revenue amongst the 6 BCS conferences. They added two teams ( Utah and Colorado - not really huge names ) and got the richest TV deal in college football. 2. Stability - the Big 12 had Texas, Oklahoma and everyone else. When Texas wanted more money than everyone else, the other teams had to accept it, or leave ( as Nebraska, Colorado and Texas A & M decided to do ). If, for example, a league has 16 teams, including Texas, Oklahoma, USC and Oregon, then no single team has enough leverage to cause instability. 3. Take power away from the BCS - the BCS makes a lot of money by controlling how the college football postseason is played. If the top 64 teams are in 4 conferences, the conferences can negotiate with each other to get rid of the BCS if they try to assert too much power. 4. Playoffs? ! Again, if we have 4 conferences with the 64 best teams, we could ( somewhat ) easily have the 4 conference champions play in a 4 - team playoff for the national championship.", "Conference alignment is a precarious balancing act. The current balance had worked for several years, but there are forces acting on this balance that serve to destabilize things. 1 ) Money Conferences negotiate more money through TV deals that are based on the bank - ability of the teams in the conference and the number of TV sets that the schools can be counted on to serve. If your conference games are desired by major markets, and lots of them, then you all get more money. This is one reason that larger conferences are attractive: if a conference that does not have a footprint in a major market can add a popular school from that missing market, then everybody gets a nice boost in annual revenues through the TV contract. 2 ) Emotion Some schools perceive themselves to be in positions of power, and some do not. In the last go - around ( 2010 ) Nebraska and Colorado felt themselves to be in low power positions for negotiating conference policy. Add to that their difficulties in recruiting talent - rich areas, and you have a recipe for discontent In this go - around ( 2011 ) Texas A & M's institutional \" powerlessness \" is becoming an emotional wedge between itself and the Big XII. They do not stand to make more money in the SEC ( in fact, less in the short term ), but they are tired of being dictated to by the haves ( Texas and OU ). They imagine that, by going to the SEC, they will command more respect due to their alignment with a more powerful conference. This may be true, or it may be false. Also, A & M suspects that future contracts in the SEC will be richer than those in the Big XII, which may or may not be true as well. However, do not discount the emotional element of this move; getting free from Texas and OU is a big selling point for them. How Texas A & M will handle the Alabamas, Floridas, and LSUs of the world, and how that could be better for them, remains to be seen. 3 ) Leverage Whereas previously all conferences ( that count ) had 11 or 12 teams, as soon as a major conference breaches that by adding to 13 or 14, the game is on. All major conferences now have to respond by adding teams to match or risk losing relative power ( and therefore negotiating ability, and therefore money ). TL; DR: Essentially, Texas A & M is kicking off an arms race by de - stabilizing the major conference balance because they are butt - hurt about not being in charge of the Big XII and being second fiddle in their own state, even though the move has a high probability of costing them many millions of dollars in the short term through contract penalties. The SEC is enabling it because it will make the member institutions more powerful, and give them better access to fertile Texas recruiting grounds.", "Let's say you have a group of friends that are models.

Those are deliberate misunderstandings. The truth is a lot simpler, but also a lot more nuanced: Internet Explorer is bundled with Windows. Other browsers are not. The fact that IE is bundled with Windows has a number of implications, many of which have made and continue to make IE less attractive to the \" savvy \" internet user than other browsers. Anti - trust trial notwithstanding, IE is still considered a component of Windows within Microsoft. Its development is tied directly to Windows; new releases of the browser closely follow new releases of Windows. Consider the following table: IE Version|Windows version ----: |: ---- 1. 0|Windows 95 1. 5|Windows NT 4 2. 0|Windows 95 OSR 1 3. 0|Windows 95 OSR 2 4. 0|Windows 98 5. 0|Windows 98se 5. 5|Windows ME 6. 0|Windows XP 7. 0|Windows XP SP2 8. 0|Windows Vista 9. 0|Windows 7 10. 0|Windows 8 Because IE is tied to the operating system that powers 90+% of the world's PCs, Microsoft is forced to be a lot more conservative and careful about the features it introduces to IE and the way it is developed. Every move it makes has huge repercussions on the Internet - at - large, for good or ill, whether Microsoft wants it to or not. They know this, and they take their responsibility ( and their power ) very seriously. And everyone else knows it as well. For many, their hatred of IE stems from their envy of what it represents: the power Microsoft has over personal computing. Take, for example, the huge issues that occurred with IE6 and Windows XP in the early 00s. Prior to that point, Microsoft's sole focus with Windows and IE was to introduce as many new features as quickly as possible. They were competing fiercely with Netscape on the browser side, because they considered Netscape to be the gravest threat to their business. The Internet was just starting to truly become mainstream, but even then no - one really knew what that meant. Everyone was transitioning from Windows 98, a DOS - based consumer OS to Windows XP which, being based on Windows NT, at least had some intrinsic security features. But Windows XP also had IE, a browser developed originally for Windows 95, a browser with crazy shit like ActiveX, embedded fonts, a wonky but functional version of JavaScript and so on. Massive security vulnerabilities. And Windows itself had not been built to expect the kinds of threats the Internet would pose, simply because Microsoft didn't know what the threats * were *; they hadn't been conceived yet. Microsoft took a massive PR beating in the early 00s, as vulnerability after vulnerability was ruthlessly exploited in Windows XP and IE 6, the latter having reached the height of its popularity after its only competition -- Netscape -- basically gave up. So Microsoft retreated. Instead of releasing the next version of Windows ( then codenamed Longhorn ) and with it, the next version of IE, they went to work adding the security features that Windows desperately needed. This delayed the release of Longhorn -- another huge PR problem for Microsoft -- but more importantly, it also delayed the release of IE 7. The internet - at - large felt that delay. IE6 became entrenched. People got used to it. It had no real competition; Netscape gave up, Firefox was too immature ( but was popular among the cool kids ), Safari only ran on Macs and Chrome didn't exist yet. Technologies and standards for websites continued to advance; CSS 2 got fleshed out, HTML 4, XHTML 1, new features in JavaScript. But IE 6, frozen as it was, didn't support them. It became an anchor, holding everything back, its sheer popularity causing the Web to stagnate. Half a decade later, Web developers and savvy web users still haven't forgiven Microsoft for that. As a web developer, I count myself among them. It remains to be seen how long it will take before we forgive. Maybe we never will. I don't, but at least I understand. Microsoft is trying mightily to win us back, of course. It largely completed the security retrofit with Windows Vista, which allowed it to focus on adding features again. IE9 represented a massive catch - up effort for IE, bringing it up to support the more stable chunks of HTML 5 and CSS 3. But the ground it lost in the 00s allowed two new competitors -- Firefox and Chrome -- to step in and beat it to the punch. And they aren't as conservative as Microsoft has to be; they can rapidly iterate their browsers, introducing new, whiz - bang features at a rapid pace, winning fans and users as they go. While Microsoft is forced to tread slowly and steadily, measuring every move they make, testing every feature they add, knowing that they can't afford any more major blunders. Such an attitude is prudent and wise, but it doesn't win them fans. Look at the current kerfuffle with WebGL. Firefox and Chrome support it, which is why you can play Angry Birds inside the Chrome browser without downloading a single plugin. Microsoft won't add support for it to IE until it can reasonably guarantee it can do it without introducing massive security vulnerabilities, and The Internet hates them for it. And so it goes."]}

Regarding your concern, I would explain that these blood pressure fluctuations are quite normal during the day. They are related to physical or emotional activity. Isolated blood pressure are not conclusive for high blood pressure. I would recommend measuring your blood pressure frequently during the day (in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax) and write those values in a notebook. You should do this for a week and then show these values to your doctor in order to make the proper changes to your actual therapy. Some blood lab tests may be needed to exclude other possible causes of blood pressure fluctuations: - complete blood count- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid dysfunction- inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate).

The amortization starts when your business is active (i. e. : you can buy the property, but not actually open the restaurant - you cannot start the depreciation). I have a couple questions about accounting - should all the money I spent be a part of capital spending? Or is it just a part of it? If it qualifies as start-up/organizational expenses - it should be capitalized. If it is spent on capital assets - then it should also be capitalized, but for different reasons and differently. For example, costs of filing paperwork for permits is a start-up expense. Buying a commercial oven is a capital asset purchase which should be depreciated separately, as buying the tables and silverware.

Germany was suffering more than most though due to the reparations enforced by the treaty of Versailles. The previous leader ( I forget his name ) decided to print more money to boost the economy. However this backfired and caused hyper inflation. It came to the point where it was more efficient to burn the money than it was to use it to buy wood for a fire. Germany was degraded and German pride was at an all time low. Interestingly in 1928, the year of the previous election Hitler and the Nazis party were pretty much laughed at, they received only 2. 8 % of the vote. The conditions at this time simply weren't right. But come 1930 the conditions were much more favourable. The Nazi party this time took around 20 % of the seats. Now the Nazi party was openly opposed to democracy but the election results meant one of the democratic parties had to make a deal with the Nazis. Through a process of bullying and intimidating the opposition the Nazi party eventually took complete control, and by 1933 the dictatorship had fallen on Germany. What came next was, for the most part, a series of blunders on the part of the rest of Europe. Hitler began restoring German pride, he vowed to destroy the Treaty of Versailles, in part by rebuilding the German military, something banned under the Treaty. In hindsight Britain and France, the two countries charged with upholding the Treaty, should have intervened here. However the world was terrified of a repeat of the Great War and so Britain and France instead choose a policy of appeasement. They allowed Germany to do as they wished, most notably by allowing them to retake control of the Rhineland in 1936. Had they intervened at this point the resulting war would likely have been won in a few weeks. The German army was not ready for war. Unfortunately we did not know this, whilst we thought we were avoiding war we were actually allowing a man, hell bent on leading a German Empire, time to develop and strengthen. By the time 1939 came around Hitler was leading a powerful and highly dangerous Germany and now, finally, it was clear the allies had to intervene.

You live your life gathering carrots, and sometimes its useful for you to be able to say, \" I have three carrots \" or \" I have two. \" Natural numbers, ( i. e. 1, 2 and up ) are good for counting things.

You invent a number, \" -3 \", to capture the idea you want, and provide a solution to this question. Now we 're ready for imaginary numbers. Here, you just have another math problem you'd like to solve. You like taking square roots, but don't like how you always have to pay attention for when it doesn't make sense.

Its all the same, numbers are always \" made up. \" Just like you 'll never find \" -3 \" carrots in your pantry, you 'll never find \" i \" books on your shelf. But its useful to have a name for answers to mathematical questions, and the same way we have rules that are interesting for negative numbers, we like to study the properties of imaginary numbers ( and functions ) as well. EDIT: Let me just add that this is something that keeps happening the higher up you go in mathematics. If there isn't a solution to an arithmetic question, its nice to just give the solution a name and treat it like its a number. I'm on the boundary of the LI5, so I 'll just stop here and summarize that the math that is the study of numbers finds it much easier ( and more interesting ) when you give names to things rather than just let them \" explode \" ( like square roots of negatives or roots of polynomial equations )."]}

In extreme cases they can have blood in their tears. Even without bleeding, the virus is released through all body fluids ( blood, saliva, teats, semen, urine, feces ). Most of most of the time the clotting problems primarily cause internal bleeding which messes with the salt ( really electrolyte ) and protein balance in the blood, which causes the blood pressure to drop, decreases liver and kidney function, and causes swelling problems. Most people die from low blood pressure rather than direct blood loss. The main thing that affect survival is getting proper medical care early -- before the internal bleeding starts.

{"prompt": "Please explain what is \"Cerebral cortex\"", "human": ["The cerebral cortex, also known as the cerebral mantle, is the outer layer of neural tissue of the cerebrum of the brain in humans and other mammals. The cerebral cortex mostly consists of the six-layered neocortex, with just 10% consisting of allocortex. It is separated into two cortices, by the longitudinal fissure that divides the cerebrum into the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The two hemispheres are joined beneath the cortex by the corpus callosum. The cerebral cortex is the largest site of neural integration in the central nervous system. It plays a key role in attention, perception, awareness, thought, memory, language, and consciousness. The cerebral cortex is part of the brain responsible for cognition. In most mammals, apart from small mammals that have small brains, the cerebral cortex is folded, providing a greater surface area in the confined volume of the cranium. Apart from minimising brain and cranial volume, cortical folding is crucial for the brain circuitry and its functional organisation. In mammals with small brains there is no folding and the cortex is smooth. A fold or ridge in the cortex is termed a gyrus (plural gyri) and a groove is termed a sulcus (plural sulci). These surface convolutions appear during fetal development and continue to mature after birth through the process of gyrification. In the human brain the majority of the cerebral cortex is not visible from the outside, but buried in the sulci. The major sulci and gyri mark the divisions of the cerebrum into the lobes of the brain. The four major lobes are the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. Other lobes are the limbic lobe, and the insular cortex often referred to as the insular lobe. There are between 14 and 16 billion neurons in the human cerebral cortex. These are organised into horizontal cortical layers, and radially into cortical columns and minicolumns. Cortical areas have specific functions such as movement in the motor cortex, and sight in the visual cortex. Visual cortex is located in the occipital lobe."]}

{"prompt": "Can someone please explain white noise ? Are there other colors ? Who first created it , what 's it for , how do you create it , who defines it is white noise vs regular noise , are there other colors ? Please explain like I'm five.", "human": ["White noise is sound that contains equal amounts of all frequencies in that are audible to humans ( generally recognized as sounds whose frequencies are between 20Hz-20, 000Hz ). It's comparable to the color white, which is a combination of all colors in the visible spectrum. However if you are generating white noise with a computer or electronic device, these sounds are not being produced at the same time. First you take a series of random pitches ( aka frequencies ) and start playing them one after another, like hitting random notes on a piano. As you start to speed up the switching from one note to the next, your brain has trouble distinguishing individual pitches. Once the speed gets fast enough - and provided the sequence is totally random - you will hear white noise. There are other colors of noise, and they have to do with how the frequency spectrum is shifted toward the low or high end. Again, using the analogy of playing notes on a piano, this would be like if you were hitting random notes but you didn't play the ones at the very top or very bottom of the keyboard as much. For example, brown noise is shifted toward the low end, so pitches that are lower in frequency are being played more often than ones that are higher. Violet noise is shifted toward high frequencies, and will sound higher to our ears than white or brown noise. White noise has many applications. It can be used in a musical context, such as for imitating the sound of a snare drum. Many people also use it as a sleep aid, because white noise has the tendency to mask a wide range of ambient noises.", "Yes, there are other colors. Pink noise for example. Each color describes the distribution of frequencies represented in the sound.", "White noise is a signal - sound, radio, whatever - that is equally strong at all frequencies at the same time. We call it ' white ' because light that has all frequencies at the same strength is white in colour. Similarly, you get red noise ( stronger in low frequencies, like red light ), pink noise ( mix of white & red ), etc. White noise is something we just encounter in nature. For instance, the electrical components called resistors make very low - level white noise, and if you amplify that signal and put it through a speaker, you 'll hear that ' kgghhh ' sound we associate with white noise. It's useful for calibrating speakers and other signal processing systems."]}

Next, once each of these marbles is on their trajectory away from the space ship and each other, the universes weakest force starts to slowly be noticeable. That is, gravity makes an appearance. Each marble is very slightly attracted to other marbles, so the massive speeds the gas initially had starts to slowly decay. Not by much, but there's this very gentle nudge towards coming back for reunion. But as particles get further away, this nudge gets weaker and weaker. However, each particle has a random speed, slowest moving particles could be turned around by this nudge. Similar scenario happens at the edge of space, on the upper layers of our atmosphere.

The whole phrase should be \" The exception proves the rule * in cases not excepted. * \" In other words, the exception proves that there must be a rule which applies the rest of the time. If someone has already stated a rule, and someone points out an exception to it, then this phrase is basically meaningless - it adds nothing to the discussion since we already know there is a rule. The phrase originates with Cicero, when he said in Latin \" exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis. \" He was talking about the law - it's important for a lawyer or legislator to be able to prove the existence of an unwritten law by the presence of exceptions to that law. Source is Fowler, via [ Wikipedia ] ( URL_1 ) and [ The Straight Dope ] ( URL_0 )", "Yeah, as far as I know, and I might not, this was a french sentence used to look smart amongst smart people in the 18th century. It is a humourous comment that tries to mean \" the fact that this example breaks the rule, and is considered an exception, mearly tells you that there is a rule, because otherwise it wouldn't be an exception \". Clearly it proves nothing. It is more of an apology for a non - universal rule. As mishgale says, if someone says this as a justification, they are just wrong. In french it is \" c'est l'exception qui confirme la règle \". . which is \" the exception that confirms the rule \". It was a famous guy. Don't know which.", "This phrase, when taken very literally, is technically incorrect. However, it's usually used in cases where the exceptions are rare and difficult to find, which proves that the rule works in the vast majority of situations. Example: Newtonian physics are technically incorrect, as they break down once you get into outer space shit. However, the fact that you have to look to space to find exceptions proves that Newtonian physics work in almost all practical, everyday situations. ( Btw, I'm not * that * knowledgeable about physics, but I'm pretty sure my statement is broad enough that I am still correct. Someone who knows better should feel free to correct me if necessary. )"]}
{"prompt": "- How do cameras work ? Both modern day and from around the time they were invented . I 've never really understood how cameras do what they do . Anyone here know ? Explain like I'm five.", "human": ["I don't know if this is what you 're after, but the way that light entered the optical system ( i. e. the lens ) always confused me, so I 'll try explaining that. In most cameras, glass lenses are used to focus the light, and project it onto the film. You may have seen a camera obscura ( a lens that focuses on to ground class [ or another translucent material ] ), and have seen that the image is upside down. The reason for this is that the light from the top left corner goes to the bottom right corner of the image. If one were to trace the path of the light, it would look something like [ this ] ( URL_0 ). If you 're wondering why it behaves that way when it goes through a lens, you 're in luck! Imaging a dark room ( not a darkroom ) that is separated in half by a sheet of paper that acts as a paper thin wall between you and the other half of the room. Now, imagine if the other half is lighted, and you 're trying to see in. There happens to be a small hole in the center of the paper where you can look through, so you decide to have a look. When you look through the hole, your view extends in a straight line based on the angle you 're looking into it, so if you were in the bottom left corner ( relative to the paper ) you'd see through to the top right corner. If you moved to the bottom right corner, you'd see to the top left corner, and so on and so forth. Now, image the medium ( the film or sensor ) as * seeing all of those views at once *. It is analogous to the wall behind you, and if you picked a point on the wall, you could trace it through the hole to the corresponding point on the other wall. What I just described to you is how a pinhole camera works, but cameras with glass lenses produce a similar result by bending the light. [ Wikipedia ] ( URL_1 ) has some good diagrams of how light goes through a lens ( In this case we 're referring to a converging lens ). However, lenses today have many different * simple * lenses in them. A simple lens looks like one in the aforementioned wikipedia article. The reason for this is so you can focus at different points. Focus is a bit more complicated, and to be honest, I don't understand it all that well, but essentially it is needed because the distance of reflected light affects how it passes through the system. This is oversimplified, but hopefully it still helps.", "It starts when light enters the camera lens just like light enters your eyes and passes through a lens which is used to bring an object into focus and project the light coming from that object against the back of your eye or in the cameras case against the a strip of film or an electronic eye / sensor. In terms of modern cameras there are actually a few different kinds of sensors involved. They usually consist of a small square which light is sent towards using the lenses in the front of the camera. The sensor itself is actually made up of millions of very tiny sensors arranged in a grid pattern, just like how a bitmap image you see on a computer screen is made up of a grid of pixels. One type of sensor ( called a 3CCD sensor ) is actually a set of three separate grids that have light split apart by a prism before it reaches each sensor, so one sensor only sees blue light, one sees red, and one sees green. A microchip acts as a brain that recombines the three primary colors sensed by the three separate sensors to create a full color image. Electronic eyes / sensors have been around since television but it wasn't until computers that it became practical to begin creating cameras that capture digital pictures. Older cameras used film instead of light sensitive electronics. The film is made of a strip of plastic coated in unique chemicals that are very sensitive to light. In a way, you could say it's so sensitive to light that the brown stuff that is exposed to light becomes \" locked \" in place and the rest is comparatively loose because light didn't hit it. In color film, different chemicals are used that each react to different colors instead of all colors. The film is taken into a dark room where the film is then sent through a bath of other chemicals which wash away some bits of the photo sensitive material that was not \" burned \" into the plastic it rests on in different degrees. The result are called negatives, which are like the color wheel opposite of the actual colors, more or less.", "earlier camera's have different parts which includes Lens, shutter, the photo sensor film, , Now when you look at say Rock On Beach through view finder the light immineting from that ROB will be taken into lens, however shutter is keeping it away from the film, hence when you click it, Shutter will open for a split sec and absorb the light and put it on photosensative film i. e. Take a photo of ROB. Then you take this film and \" develope it on paper so that the image taken is printed properly. Now with digital camera, Its capture differently ( i wo nt explain since I do nt know )."]}

However, video formats do demand much more resources and are found in a myriad of different algorithms and protocols, many proprietary, while GIFs were supported natively by browsers since the Netscape days. [ EDIT ] It's worth mentioning that, despite not being the most bandwidth / storage efficient format, GIFs were still preferred in the old Internet days due to the way they store the image.

That said hive organisms work a bit like computer programs, individual nodes have limited intelligence, but communicate some fixed amount of signals ( food is this way, i am carrying a baby ) and know how to respond to a few signals ( you 're hungry? have some sugar ) These interactions orchestrate a kind of engine / algorithm which grows the colony.

{"prompt": "Will unpaid taxes prevent me from getting a business license?", "human": ["Generally these things are unrelated. Your tax debt is to agency X, your license is (mostly) from agency Y. If your business involves agency X, then it may be a problem. For example, you cannot get a EA license (IRS Enrolled Agent) if you have unsettled tax debt or other tax compliance issues. You should check Michigan state licensing organizations if there are similar dependencies. Also, some background checks may fail, and some state licenses require them to pass. For example, you can probably not get an active bar registration or a CPA license with an unsettled tax debt. You might have a problem with registering as a Notary Public, or other similar position. You can probably not work in law enforcement as a contractor. If you're on an approved payment plan - then your tax debt is settled unless you stop paying as agreed, and shouldn't be a problem."]}

{"prompt": "What does \" cap and trade \" mean ? And what part does it play in politics ( read : the coming presidential election ) ? Please explain like I'm five.", "human": ["Most people agree that pollution is bad. It can harm water, air, food, etc: it's a bad thing. Unfortunately, people ( and businesses ) will be polluting. Unless we want to stop driving cars, manufacturing, etc, then it will happen. Keep in mind that someone will be paying the costs of pollution. If Chevy pumps a bunch of stuff in the atmosphere which makes you sick then you are paying for Chevy's pollution. If \" Chevy \" pays the cost to reduce pollution then the employees, stockholders, and people who want cheap cars will be paying the costs. It's a whole jumble because everything is connected. Even worse! It may be that Ford can reduce 100 pollutants for $ 3. 00, while Apple can reduce 100 pollutants for $ 1. 00. We don't want to fuck them over via regulation, so how can we get a program to encourage the cheapest way to reduce pollutants? The question then is: how do we juggle A ) pollution is bad, with B ) pollution is inevitable, with C ) who should pay for it, with D ) how can we inexpensively reduce pollutants? Cap and trade is basically as follows: > We will give each company a \" free pass \" to pollute a certain amount. They can then reduce their pollution or, if cheaper, sell their free pass to a different company. That encourages efficiency while reducing pollution. You asked about the presidential election. Pollutants aren't limited to bad air; they can include contributing to climate change. Trump has called climate change: * A hoax * A Chinese invention * Claimed to be joking when he said it was Chinese invention * A hoax * Bullshit * A \" very, very, expensive form of tax \" * A canard * Not real * However, when he wants to build a seawall for a property climate change is very legitimate I do not think it unfair to conclude that someone like that will not be interested in addressing climate change. Further, I do not think they will be interested in harnessing pollution via cap and trade or any other manner. > And what part does it play in politics ( read: the coming presidential election )? Cap and trade is a way to control pollutants and control climate change. One candidate treats it as a joke.", "Basically it's a form of economic policy, where you attempt to discourage consumption of something ( normally due to negative externalities ) by * capping * the production quantity ( or quantity of pollutants, for example ) and allowing them to be traded. A negative externality is a cost bared by a third party. Take for example air pollution. Me polluting the air by making widgets has a tiny cost ( poor air quality ) for myself ( it's a small amount of pollution ), but everyone in the area pays that cost as well, adding up to a significant cost that I simply ignore, because I only pay a tiny part of it. So the commons ( in this case the sky ) gets destroyed because each person destroying it can't make a difference on their own. So you could cap the number of widgets that can be made, or the amount of pollution that can be emitted. To distribute these you might sell them, allowing them to be traded freely ( as a \" right to pollute \" ). This is political because there's losers - people who make and buy widgets will suffer higher costs. For example, a cap and trade scheme on air pollution would be bad news for drivers of petrol cars, car salesmen, car companies, tollway companies, etc, etc.", "Cap and trade is a system intended to reduce the production of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that is most responsible for global warming. In theory, it is simple. Everyone gets a limit on how much carbon they are allowed to produce. If you use less than your limit, you can sell your share to someone else. It makes it more expensive to produce lots of carbon, and cheaper to use less. The problem is that in practice cap and trade is far more complex. The government needs to create a way of measuring how much carbon each person produces, keeping track of how much they 've used, regulating a marketplace for buying and selling, and regulators to enforce the rules of the market. A recently failed cap and trade bill was over 1700 pages long. It is a very complex system to set up. For reference, the US constitution, when printed as a small paperback, is around 80 pages long. That recently failed cap and trade bill was over 20 times longer than the constitution. Cap and trade is never going to work. Neither major party supports cap and trade. Democrats don't like the trade part, Republicans don't like the cap part. Running the program requires a lot of bureaucracy, making the government bigger. Conservatives really don't like that sort of thing. The system is so complicated that it will be impossible to run cap and trade without loopholes undermining the system. There is a far better system, Carbon Fee and Dividend. This program adds a slowly increasing fee to fossil fuels. This fee is placed on carbon sources when they enter the economy. It's charged to the company running the oilfields, the coal mines, or the incoming tanker ship from overseas. This will increase the price of carbon fuels. Gas will be slightly more expensive. But, the government doesn't keep the fee. They pay the fee back to the people. This is a market based solution. It makes fossil fuels more expensive, making it more profitable for companies to switch to renewables. The fee increases in a predictable manner, so businesses can plan for the future. It doesn't require increasing the size of the government. The program can be run through agencies we already have. Most Americans will get more money back from the dividend than they pay in increased prices. So they will continue to support it, and it's unlikely to be eliminated when the next administration gets into office. Carbon Fee and Dividend is a far better system than Cap and Trade, and will be a good long - term solution for reducing global warming."]}

{"prompt": "The \" Loudness War \" in Music Recording What is the loudness war , and why does dynamic range get sacrificed ? Would n't it be common sense to not make loud records to preserve the range ? Explain like I'm five.", "human": ["Loudness War. Pro's - People's ears prefer ' Loud ', it grabs our attention, more attention = more records sold, it sounds ' punchy ' Con's - Everyone does it nowadays, no - one ' stands out ' anymore, after a while your ears get tired. It really started with the advent of CD's and digital mixing / mastering equipment and has sort of spiralled into ridiculousness. There are many advocates today in favor of stopping this ' war ' and returning to more dynamic recording practices. In the ' old days ', dynamic range was pretty much all we had. Every recording medium has a maximum loudness. Using old analogue circuitry, and recording to tape is quite a bit different from recording to digital. When recording to digital, you have an absolute 0db ceiling, where if you push the signal above that [ Clipping ] ( URL_4 ) occurs. So, you have this ceiling, but you want to push your mix louder. Mastering engineers started using compressors and limiters on their tracks which keep the high peaks at or just below peak volume, but bring the quieter passages and sounds up in volume, making the overall track sound louder, but losing dynamic range. Check [ this ] ( URL_1 ) wiki page for more of an overview, look at the waveforms on the right for Michael Jacksons ' Black and White ' and how it has changed from original release in 91 ' through to its re - re - release in 2007. Also of note is Metallica's ' Death Magnetic ' which caused a shitstorm when the highly compressed, flat sound CD was compared to the much more reasonably mixed Guitar Hero version. The wiki can go into much more detail than I can if you fancy the read, and I 'll stick a couple of youtube vids below [ The Loudness War ] ( URL_0 ) [ Metallica Comparison ] ( URL_2 ) [ Nirvana Comparison ] ( URL_3 ) Just listening to those examples... . the Loudness War sucks", "Radio stations will compress every song to grab listeners attention while they 're seeking through channels. Think about it, you 're seeking through the channels, and a big loud song comes on, and grabs your attention. It's likely you 're going to stay on that channel and continue listening, thereby listening to their advertisers. The problem is that these songs are already compressed through mixing and mastering stages. After the mastering stage, the song has been through two sets of * highly trained * ears, to bring out the nuances of the song, and massage the dynamics to allow the best possible mix reach the listener's ears. What radio channels will do is throw a \" one size fits all \" Normaliser to ALL songs, regardless of if that sound works or not, they just want listener's ears for advertising money. This undoes all the work of highly trained ears, and does nothing but to push the song as close to 0. 0dB normalisation as possible. It can also create clipping ( distortion ) and phasing problems if the normaliser doesn't play nice with the song. Now, the \" wars \" part begins with radio stations constantly pushing the normaliser closer and closer to the ceiling, and then pushing the dynamic range closer and closer to nil to make sure there aren't any noticeable quiet spots to a song, which might mean they lose a listener. Basically what this means, is that not only are the quiet parts being brought * * up * * they loud parts are being brought * * down * * so allow for the lower parts to be brought up even more. * This may seem confusing, but think about it like a water wave in a boxed room: having a talk wave will leave a lot of air in between the wave, as opposed to a long flat wave, which you can push as close to the roof as possible. * Because people are changing how they inject media, radio stations have been given more pull at the same time that they become desperate for younger listeners. What this equals is them having day with producers. Introduce Metallica. Upon mastering, the engineer pushed the limits of his normaliser as far as possible, and this is even before the radio station's own unit. What this created was an album that was essentially devoid of any dynamic nuances to try to bring listeners in, and also to make it that \" album to crank \". Fortunately, more people than not have ears that can hear dynamics, and appreciate them, and this created a backlash and rerelease with a toned down master. The Loudness Wars stem from radio stations hungry for more users, and have the loser being the music and our ears. The best way to combat them is to write your stations to say you don't like the sound, and to tone it down with the normaliser. TL: DR - Radio stations try to catch seeking radio listeners with loud songs. They compete with loudness against each other until songs are devoid of all dynamics and are stripped of musical quality. Listen to another release to get a good version of a song.", "When you record an album there is an absolute limit to how loud the album can be. In the past, albums were recorded in such a way that they rarely reached that upper limit. However, with the widespread adoption of digital technology, it has become easier to make albums approach that upper limit more often. This has got to the point where many artists record the vast majority of their album at that threshold. For example, very few parts of a dubstep album are quiet. Now the war concept comes in to play because album sales generally favour the louder album. Consider how music is broadcast. If a song is louder straight from the CD, it will be more noticeable in just about every situation. Therefore producers and mixers use incredible amounts of compression to make albums as loud as they can. Audiophiles on the other hand, dislike loud albums, and think that this war is destroying music. Some go so far as to compare older albums with their remastered and conclude that over compression and loudness destroys the subtleties in music. Does loudness affect dynamic range? Yes absolutely! When we talk about loudness we talk about the average dynamic range for the album / song. Lets say dynamic range is a number between 1 - 10. Lets take stairway to heaven. It starts on a 1, moves through to 5 when the drums come in, crescendos at 10 for the guitar solo, then ends back on 1. Compare that to a Skrillex or a Rhianna song which starts on 8, goes to 11, comes back down a bit, then the bass drops and it goes to 12! Unfortunately there are no compromises in the loudness war... The problem as I see it is a clash of musicality and audiophilia. Remember that musicality is all about artistry, and audiophilia is all about interpretation of the sound ( Production vs. Reception ). There are numerous artists who produce loud albums, but are still brilliant musicians. There are many artists who play with tons of dynamic range, but their music is shit.

The second is getting to the asteroid and matching its orbit. Got that down quite well with the ability to figure out where the asteroid's orbit will take it. The third is selecting a spot to land. That can be performed by imaging the asteroid and determining a likely spot. The final one is programming the propulsion systems on the orbiter part to drop its lander on the asteroid. With all the data you 've collected so far, this is also achievable using sophisticated computer - driven propulsion systems with distance - detection measurement devices and self - correcting capability.

Nothing in space is standing still. Everything is moving in orbit around something else. Our sun orbits around the centre of the galaxy. Our galaxy and the local galaxy group orbit around their centre of gravity. What you want to do is make sure you orbit the centre of gravity ( the Sun, in this case ) at the same speed and with the same orbital parameters that the asteroid does. So it's like the car analogy that u / Xalteox made: when you 're next to an asteroid at exactly the same speed, you wouldn't notice that the asteroid is moving. So how do we get to the asteroid? Very basically ( and I 'll skip the launch part ), you 're in Earth orbit, travelling a few hundred kilometres above the surface at around 7, 700 m / s - that's roughly 17, 000 mph or 28, 000 km / h. We need to change our orbit so it crosses that of the asteroid. Timing is important - crossing the asteroid's orbit when it's on the other side of the sun is useless. The time where you can burn to intercept is the transfer window. Theoretically, it wouldn't matter that much, only you would need very, * very * large amounts of fuel, a much larger engine to propel the much heavier spacecraft and maybe several billions of dollars. That's not feasable, so we wait for the transfer window. Once it comes, we burn the engine for a while until we 're at such a speed that Earth's gravity can no longer pull us back around. Think of a car on a racetrack that's too fast to go around a curve and skids off the track - that's what we 're trying to do here. Only our result will be that we 'll change from orbiting Earth to orbiting the Sun. Once we are at the intercept point ( and hopefully we got everything right and the asteroid is also there ), we burn the engines again for a while, changing our speed until our orbit of the Sun matches that of the asteroid. And then we do what the other posters said: use thrusters to gently manoeuvre us down to the surface. As I said, this is the very basic version. If you want to try something like that, I 'll shamelessly advise you to download the free demo version of Kerbal Space Program from Steam.

Earlier this year, I sold a house that was financed with a \"Hard Money\" loan. Not a bank, but a group of investors. They charged the buyer 10%. Let me state - I represented the seller, and when I found out the terms of the loan, it would have been a breach of my own moral and legal responsibility to her to do anything to kill the deal. I felt sick for days after that sale. There are many people with little credit history who are hard workers and have saved their 20% down. For PeerStreet, 25%.

So the first person calls the second person, and tells them what's happening. After that call the second person calls the third person, and so on. The nice thing about this is that each person only has to remember 1 name and number ( the next person in line they are supposed to call ). Even though everyone only calls 1 person, the whole community still finds out about what is happening. If someone moves away from the community ( person # 25 let's say ) all you have to do is tell the person who used to call them ( person # 24 ) that they have a new person they need to call ( person # 26 ) and the system still works. A LinkedList is kindof like that. Each element only knows itself and where to point for the next element in the list. If you start at the beginning, you can repeatedly go to the next element and you will eventually traverse the entire list. If you need to remove an element all you have to do is change where the previous element points to ( so if you have A- > B- > C- > D, and you want to remove C, you just set B to point to D. C is removed from the list ). If you need to add an element anywhere in the list all you do is change 1 pointer in the old list and make the new element point to the proper spot ( Again, say you have A- > B- > C- > D, and you want to add X between B and C. Make B point to X, and X point to C, giving you A- > B - > X- > C- > D )."]}

Can they leave ? What are they doing ? Explain like I'm five.", "human": ["I lived alongside some monks in a small Soutou Zen temple in Japan for a few weeks. To become a monk is to dedicate your life to your religion. Your regular life is formulated around the religion instead of religion being just a small part of your life. If you are curious as to the daily life of a monk here is my experience, we did exactly the same things as the monks, for that short time we were there we were considered the same as them. Keep in mind this is a very small temple of less than 20 monks and is not actually usually opened to visitors. Things will differ depending on religious sect and size of the temple. We woke up around 5 am, washed our teeth and faces in communal sinks, and then headed to the meditation hall. You had to be ready and sitting on your zafu ( meditation pillow ) by a certain time, 5. 45am if I remember correctly. The start of meditation was indicated by two gongs, rung by the abbot or leader of the temple who sat in the middle of the hall. Soutou Zen style meditation is very particular. You sit on a zafu which is a small round pillow to support yourself. You sit with your legs crossed, in lotus position if you are flexible enough, but regular \" indian style \" is fine. You are facing the wall, sitting upright, with your hands folded into the cosmic mudra, eyes open but relaxed and looking downwards. Here is a great image of zazen or sitting meditation: URL_0 The person on the left has his eyes closed which is not recommended. The aim of meditation is quite difficult to convey. To put simply, you sit to sit. The point is to be able to sit and only sit, not worry about the future or be stuck in the past. This is extremely difficult actually, and it takes years of practice to be able to do this. After sitting meditation is over, the gongs are rung again and you turn around from facing the wall to facing the inside of the hall. Breakfast is served while you are sitting on your mat. Actually, a great deal of a monk's whole life occurs within the confines of one tatami mat: URL_1 One mat is the space inside the green edges. A monk has a shelf or two where his 3 bowls, chopsticks, and cleaning element is located, carefully wrapped in a furoshiki or wrapping cloth. They also have some shaving equipment and perhaps an extra set of robes as well as some bedding. That is all their earthly possessions. Breakfast is served and eaten in complete silence. In zen, every activity is a practice in mindfulness. When you eat, the goal is to eat and to be completely in that moment. The abbot would remind us to thoroughly chew, to completely taste and appreciate the texture and flavor of the food, and think of all the different people that worked to be able to grow a rice plant, harvest it, process it, have it shipped to the market, the person who bought it, cooked it, prepared it, etc. You take your wrapped set, and carefully unwrap and separate all the utensils, in complete silence, in the small wooden space in front of your tatami mat. You wait, sitting seiza ( URL_2 ) as the servers come around with food. The menu changes every day, but it is always similar. There is some brown rice, some protein ( tofu or beans ), and some vegetables and miso soup, along with pickles. Everything is vegetarian ( and super delicious too! ) Before you start eating, you take a few grains of rice and set it aside. A server comes around and collect the grains from each person, and throws them in the courtyard. It is a symbolic offering to the \" hungry ghosts \" or people who are driven by intense desire and can not be content with themselves. After eating, a server comes around with tea, usually roasted green tea or houjicha. Because you only have three bowls, this is poured into the largest bowl, where your rice was. Before completely finishing your tea, you pour a small amount in the medium bowl, swish it around, and then finally pour it into the smallest bowl. You take your cleaning element which is a flat wooden stick with a piece of white cloth tied to the end of it. You first clean your chopsticks, then the largest bowl, medium, and finally the smallest, using the tea as a cleaner. The tea is consumed at the end, and the cleaning cloth is sucked dry in your mouth because nothing must be wasted. After meditation and breakfast, we performed a sort of mass, which is sitting in the main hall and reciting sutras, followed afterwords by the day's lesson given by the abbot. Afterwards there is usually some sort of maintenance and upkeep that must be done for the temple. One day it might be pulling weeds in the garden and planting new plants, another day it might be cleaning the toilets and shower, another day might be cleaning the outside areas of the temple, etc. Even during these chores it is stressed that this is a meditation practice as well and to try to live in that moment and put your full effort and focus into the task, even if it is something as mundane as pulling weeds. After daily chores, lunch and tea is served. This is much more informal, but silence is still observed. During tea there is time for some chatting if I remember correctly. Then there is some free time to do whatever you want, whether it is studying, relaxing, wandering around the grounds or beautiful mountainous woods, talking with friends, etc. In the evening there is dinner, which is eaten in the main hall. It is a bit more informal but served in the same way in silence. Dishes are done by the day's chosen cleaning staff instead of cleaned by yourself. After dinner there is another round of sitting meditation. By this time it is 10 - 11pm at night and most people chose to go to bed right away because each day is full and exhausting. That is the basic rundown of an average day. There are also other special days where special tasks must be done, like performing takuhatsu ( URL_3 ) which is going around the neighborhood asking the residents for donations. You walk around in robes, a bamboo hat, and straw sandals ( that absolutely kill your feet. ) One or two monks will carry around a small bag with the temple's name on it to put any received money. You walk around the neighborhood and recite sutras along the way so that people may hear you, occasionally stopping at houses. If someone comes out to donate, we recite a special sutra for them as a sign of thanks, receive the money, thank them, and move on. One nice lady invited us in for cold tea and snacks which was a godsend because it was scorchingly hot that day. The donations are used to maintain the physical temple, buy food and anything else that the monks need. It is also a symbolic gesture to show the laypeople the nature of our interconnectedness and reliance upon one another. It was hard to talk to many of the monks because my Japanese was very poor at the time, but two of them spoke English. The reasons for being a monk vary greatly. One was a young Japanese man who had traveled a lot, and decided to be a monk for a while just for the experience and as a way to live and survive. He ended up staying longer than he expected. Some are born into temple families and follow the family's religious path, some are people looking for religious experience, enlightenment or whatever. The monks have off days, where there is very little work and teaching so a monk is free to do as he wishes. Some go into town to interact with other people, some stay on temple grounds. They are all pretty normal people, enjoy a good beer, good food, and are looking to make a family. They just chose a different path to walk in life because they did not see happiness in material objects.", "OP mentioned Buddhism in a comment, and the school I'm most familiar with is Zen ( an offshoot of Buddhism that is particularly popular in Japan ), so I'm going to use that as a base line, but the three tasks I'm about to describe are so universal, that they apply to most Asian religions. Teach, learn, and maintain temples. Basically, a Buddhist monk's job is the same as a Priest or Rabbi, they just go about doing it in a slightly different way. I 'll explain vows and things like that in a moment, but for now, lets just break down those three \" roles. \" When I say teach, I mean that it is a monk's job to to tell people who aren't monks ( laypeople ) how to live a good Buddhist life. A monk should also be able to teach people who aren't familiar with Buddhism about the main points of Buddhism ( karma, samsara, and a whole lot of things I don't have time to get into now ). When I say learn, I mean that it is very important for a monk to know a lot about his religion ( he should know what The Buddha has to say about a variety of important subjects, as well as a what other monks and masters have said ); obviously this goes hand in hand with the first role of teaching, if a layperson comes to him with a difficult question, a good monk will reflect on that question and try to come up with an adequate answer. The fourteenth Dalai Lama ( a really important figure in Tibetan Buddhism ) once said, \" If scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims. \" In this sense, one of a monks roles is to question the very beliefs Buddhism is based on. The third role is pretty mundane, but monks are also responsible for maintaining the shrines and temples in their area. This can mean anything from handyman work, cleaning, selling charms and performing exorcisms, to hiring ( and paying ) others to do these things for them. This may seem weird to Westerners, but running a temple in Japan is very much like a business. The head of many temples is a position that is passed down from parent to child, and unlike the west ( where churches run mainly off of donations ), Japanese temples provide services for a fee. Those fees then go back into maintaining the temple. As for vows and the like, think of it like this; what a monk needs to do to live a good life, and what a layperson needs to do to live a good life, are fundamentally different. Monks are expected to hold themselves to much higher standards than average Buddhists, because they are supposed to be the role model ( remember that teaching role? ) that the rest of us base our actions on. In return, for holding themselves to these higher standards, monks are able to reach enlightenment faster than laypeople.", "In general, monks are members of a religious organization that don't preach to laymen ( People who aren't a part of their religions structure ). What they actually do varies wildly. Some of the medieval monks were scholars and artisans, copying old tomes and bibles. Other monks could be guardians, scholars, medicine men, or really anything."]}

{"prompt": "How do computers read and \" produce \" the 1 and 0 they use to send commands ? I understand they use 1 's and 0 's , but where do they come form , and what exactly are they ? Explain like I'm five.", "human": ["Well the 1s and 0s are ways we have of thinking about information as if it could only be one of two different things. Exactly what we represent with which bit isn't important, as long as you understand that 1 is not 0, and 0 is not 1. Where they come from, on the other hand, is from any number of places a computer can interact with. For example, computers run on electricity, so when a computer wants to send information from one place to another it sends these \" pulses \" of electricity over a wire. A higher voltage pulse will mean a 1, and a lower voltage pulse will mean a 0. But there are other parts of a computer that still use 0s and 1s that aren't electric, like the hard drive. The hard drive stores 1s and 0s by changing the magnetic poles of small parts of a metal disk. Positive and negative charges would be 1s or 0s. So you can see how these real - life things can be changed to represent bits. Now you 're probably wondering why, and what significance do bits have? How can a 1 or a 0 be turned into important information? Well, I'm lazy, and I happen to already have an ELI5 explaining the nature of information to someone who was asking how DNA can be turned into information: URL_0 However, in summary, we use combinations of bits and say that different combinations have different meanings. So we might say that 0010 means the number 2, and 0011 means the number 3 ( which it does, and there is strange math involved that requires re - learning how to count ). From there, as long as everyone agrees that this is the case and these combinations do mean these things, we can start to make bigger groups of these bits that can be interpreted as instructions that can make computers do different things. Hope this helps! EDIT: confusing sentence structure fixed", "The way it worked in original computers was that you had racks of vacuum tubes wired up together which would make up the computers memory. Each one of these vacuum tubes is a single bit; that is, a single on / off, yes / no, 1/0. The computer could read and write the on / off state and represent it as 1's and 0 's. Now with disk ~~and solid state~~ hard drives the concept is the same but instead of checking the on / off state of a vacuum tube, it checks the magnetization of the disk. edit: TIL solid state drives are a whole different beast.", "Computers don't necessarily \" produce \" 1's and 0's in the sense that they don't manufacture them. Rather, they \" present \" hardware states that are interpreted as numbers. By state, I don't mean a state like Texas, I mean a particular condition that a hardware piece is in at a specific time. For example, think of a light switch. It can be in either two states: up or down. For the sake of this example, consider up to be on, and down to be off. The state ( or condition ) of the switch is determined by the physical position of the switch. Now, flipping the switch doesn't produce 1's and 0 's, but we can interpret the position of the switch such that on=1 and off=0. An item that can only have two states can be considered binary. In computers, a single binary unit is referred to as a bit. Multiple bits can be grouped together to store numbers larger than 1. When this happens we are using base - two ( binary ) counting. When you count with your fingers, you 're essentially using base-10 ( decimal ) counting that you 're familiar with. Now, think of a wall with one of those panels that have two light switches on them. Again, flipping the switches doesn't produce 1's or 0 's, but we 're going to interpret the position of each switch as to represent a 1 or 0. With two switches there are four possible combinations or 2 X 2 = 4 or, more accurately, 2 ^ 2 = 4: * Switch 1: on or off * Switch 2: on or off Although we have 4 possible states, we typically consider the state with everything off as 0. * State 1: Switch 1 off and Switch 2 off = 0 * State 2: Switch 1 on and Switch 2 off = 1 * State 3: Switch 1 off and Switch 2 on = 2 * State 4: Switch 1 on and Switch 2 on = 3 In computers, a cluster of 8 bits ( think switches ) is called a byte. With a byte, we can have up to 256 possible states since we can have up to 256 different possible combinations of bits being on or off. There are many different types of hardware for storing binary data, but they essentially can all be thought of as machines with lots and lots and lots of tiny switches in them. In computers, everything is based on binary numbers. In order to keep everything being one giant confusing number, we reserve groups of bits for different purposes. To explain this, I 'll use a city metaphor. Feel free to draw things out on a piece of paper as you follow along. Imagine you are standing outside of a single story building, at night, with 8 windows in a line. If the light in a room is turned on, the room will light up. Think of each room as a bit. If you see it lit up, you interpret it as a 1. If it's dark, you interpret it as 0. Since you have 8 bits, the building effectively represents a byte of data. Now imagine the same building, but with 2 floors instead of 1. You have 2 rows of 8 windows, with each window representing a bit. Remember how I said earlier that you can have 256 possible combinations with 8 bits? Now we have 2 rows of 8 bits, or 16 bits. With 16 bits, we can have 2 ^ 16 = 65, 536 possible combinations, which is also the maximum value we can store ( all bits are turned on ). Lets designate this building as \" Storage 1 \". Now, imagine an identical 2 story building right next to it called \" Storage 2 \". Now we have 2 buildings of 16 bits, or 32 bits total. However, we 've effectively reserved each group of 16 bits into separate groups. Next, we have a 3rd building with a single story of 2 windows, or 2 bits, called \" op_code \" and a 4th building with 4 floors of 8 windows. This single building effectively contains 32 bits by itself. We 'll call this one \" result \". Result is different than storage 1 and 2 and op - code in that it's read - only. Imagine the building is locked and you don't have the key to get in. As a result, you can't set the switches yourself to turn the lights on and off, you can only look at them. Finally, we 'll have a small square building with no windows. We 'll call this one \" compute \". Inside there are special switches called logic gates. Logic gates take 1 or more input switches and usually have a singular output switch that is read - only. This effectively means that while you can set the input switch or switches, you can't set the output switch, only look at it. Feel free to look up the different types of logic gates yourself. For right now, it's sufficient to say that logic gates can be combined and arranged in different ways to perform mathematical operations. To recap: two identical 2 - story buildings containing 16 windows each called storage 1 and storage 2, a 4 - story building containing 32 windows by itself called result a small square building called compute, and finally a single story building with 2 windows in a row, called op_code. You can think of each of these buildings as a representation of a type of computer chip. Modern computers use special chips called \" system on chip \" meaning a single chip has several internal \" chips \" inside of it. Each of these \" system on chips \" is like an electronic city unto itself. However, computer chips don't have eyes and can't \" see \" bits. Instead, they are wired together so that when a bit is on, electricity flows through it. Imagine that each window in storage one and storage 2 has an extension cord connecting it to the compute building, All 16 wires from each storage building are plugged into a single side of the compute building. Storage 1 is plugged into side one of compute building and storage 2 is plugged into side 2 of compute building. If you were to turn on the a light in one of the storage buildings, it would also send power through that room's extension cord to the compute building. Now, imagine that the op - code building has 2 wires ( one for each window ) wired up to the third side of the compute building. Finally, the 4th side of the compute building is wired up to the result building. Since op - code has 2 windows, we have 4 possible combinations. We 're going to let each combination represent a command: * 1: off - off ( 00 ) is do nothing * 2: off - on ( 01 ) is add storage 1 and storage 2 * 3: on - off ( 10 ) is subtract storage 2 from storage 1 * 4: and on - on ( 11 ) is multiply storage 1 and storage 2. All operations except off - off cause the lights in the result building to reflect the binary result of the operation. For example, using the add op - code ( off - on ) causes the lights in result to indicate the sum of storage 1 and storage 2. As an example, Imagine that you running around this imaginary town. You turn on the lights in storage one and storage two such that the windows look like this ( 1 is lit - up ): * Storage 1: * 00000000 * 00000011 * Storage 2: * 00000000 * 00000001 Next you run to the op code building and flip the light switches so that it has the following binary value: 01 Remember, 01 is to add. Unseen to you, 01 has allowed the power from storage 1 and storage 2 to be routed to the logic gates used for addition in the compute building. Consequently the windows on the result building look like this: * 00000000 * 00000000 * 00000000 * 00000100 By doing so, you 've effectively added 11 ( binary for 3 ) and 1 ( binary for 1 ), resulting in 100 ( binary for 4 ). You should now have a very basic understanding of how computers operate. Lots of bits, groups of which are reserved for different things, are wired together such that other groups of bits act as commands to perform computations. If you want to understand how text and other things are represented, look at an ASCII chart. Effectively, a byte is used for a single character. Each possible combination of the bits within the byte is reserved to represent a different character. It's still all binary numbers, is just that when people design computers to be compatible with each other, they agree to bind their designs to conform to standards like ASCII.

Of course, someone can always pretend to be the remote server and get your information that way, but there are some safeguards against that as well. # 1 Provides visible authentication: Before an SSL session is established, the server it connects with needs to have a digital certificate – a kind of unique digital identification to establish its authenticity. Digital certificates are issued by a Certification Authority, after performing several checks to confirm the identity of the organization to which it is issuing the certificate. An SSL digital certificate generates a public key for your customers and a private key on your server that works as a kind of official, online stamp for your enterprise. This private key needs to be kept secure, along with a back - up. A user can check to see if a secure session has been established by looking at the web address: in a secure session, the ' http: ' portion of the web address changes to ' https: '. # 2 Assures data integrity: This basically ensures that nobody can tamper with the data or information that is already online.

{"prompt": "How do I do double-entry bookkeeping for separately-managed investment accounts?", "human": ["For any accounts where you have a wish to keep track of dividends, gains and losses, etc. , you will have to set up a an account to hold the separately listed securities. It looks like you already know how to do this. Here the trading accounts will help you, especially if you have Finance: Quote set up (to pull security prices from the internet). For the actively-managed accounts, you can just create each managed account and NOT fill it with the separate securities. You can record the changes in that account in summary each month/year as you prefer. So, you might set up your chart of accounts to include these assets: And this income: The actively-managed accounts will each get set up as Type \"Stock. \" You will create one fake security for each account, which will get your unrealized gains/losses on active accounts showing up in your trading accounts. The fake securities will NOT be pulling prices from the internet. Go to Tools -> Securities Editor -> Add and type in a name such as \"Merrill Lynch Brokerage, \" a symbol such as \"ML1, \" and in the \"Type\" field input something like \"Actively Managed. \" In your self-managed accounts, you will record dividends and sales as they occur, and your securities will be set to get quotes online. You can follow the general GnuCash guides for this. In your too-many-transactions actively traded accounts, maybe once a month you will gather up your statements and enter the activity in summary to tie the changes in cost basis. I would suggest making each fake \"share\" equal $1, so if you have a $505 dividend, you buy 505 \"shares\" with it. So, you might have these transactions for your brokerage account with Merrill Lynch (for example): When you have finished making your period-end summary entries for all the actively-managed accounts, double-check that the share balances of your actively-managed accounts match the cost basis amounts on your statements. Remember that each fake \"share\" is worth $1 when you enter it. Once the cost basis is tied, you can go into the price editor (Tools -> Price Editor) and enter a new \"price\" as of the period-end date for each actively-managed account. The price will be \"Value of Active Acct at Period-End/Cost of Active Acct at Period-End. \" So, if your account was worth $1908 but had a cost basis of $505 on Jan. 31, you would type \"1908/505\" in the price field and Jan. 31, 2017 in the date field. When you run your reports, you will want to choose the price source as \"Nearest in Time\" so that GnuCash grabs the correct quotes. This should make your actively-managed accounts have the correct activity in summary in your GnuCash income accounts and let them work well with the Trading Accounts feature."]}

For example, HSBC on the NYSE yields 4. 71% versus HSBC on the LSE which yields only 4. 56%. Assuming the shares are truly identical, the only reason for this (aside from market fluctuations) is if the taxes are more favorable in the UK versus the US, thus increasing demand for HSBC on the LSE, raising the price, and reducing the yield. A difference of 0. 15% in yield is pretty insignificant relative to a 30% versus 0% dividend tax. But a key question is, does your country have a foreign tax credit like the US does? If so you (usually) end up getting that 30% back, just delayed until you get your tax return, and the question of which exchange to buy on becomes not so clear cut. If your country doesn't have such a tax credit, then yes, you'll want to buy on an exchange where you won't get hit with the dividend tax.

They can miss some payments but can still make the payments and become ' current ' with the loan. Standard installment contracts mean one missed payment and the seller can repossess the item.

Buyers would make a down payment and begin make monthly payments which would eventually result in the mortgage being paid.

{"prompt": "How do processed foods increase the risk of cancer ? In other words , how do foods cause uncontrollable mutation of cells ? Explain like I'm five. ", "human": ["The mechanisms for how chemicals can increase the risk of cancer is very interesting! First let's quickly go over the genetics of cancer. We have at two categories of genes that are involved in cancer: oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Oncogenes are naturally there for cell division ( for healing wounds and growing and such ). However, if a mutation occurs in an oncogene, this can result in uncontrolled growth and division of the cell. Meanwhile, tumor suppressor genes are there to STOP or mediate cell division and growth. Mutation of a tumor suppressor gene is usually recessive ( you would need the gene on both copies of the chromosome to be mutated for it to have an effect ), however, this can also lead to uncontrolled growth. Now, the way these chemicals can increase our risk of cancer is by increasing the chance of mutations in our DNA. Mutations occur when there is a mistake in our DNA when the cell divides ( because the DNA has to be replicated, so those mistakes will be passed on to the daughter cells ). This can be cause by DNA damage. The chemicals may have certain groups of atoms that are particularly dangerous. For example, the chemical may introduce \" free radicals \". Free radicals are single electrons that wreak havoc in their path to find a partner. This can damage our DNA. When our molecular machines repair our DNA it is another opportunity for a mistake to happen. If this mistake isn't caught by the time the cell divides, well, you should get it by now haha. All it takes is a mutation in an oncogene to lead to a tumor. Also, certain chemicals are not harmful to us until our own enzymes metabolize them. The reason why we metabolize them is so that we can change the molecules into a form that can dissolve in water ( so we can pee it out ). Otherwise, an \" oil and water \" effect will occur and we will never be able to pee out the chemical. However, these water - soluble forms or their intermediates ( the forms in between their oil - soluble and water - soluble forms ) may end up being carcinogenic ( increase the risk of cancer ). Not all processed foods increase the risk of cancer. It's a factor of studying the various chemical preservatives they use in the food.", "The uncontrollable mutation of cells is a result of something damaging the DNA of cells. All sorts of things can damage their DNA, including chemicals you ingest or inhale.

Like if you were trying to figure out where a truck was by slamming cars into it and listening for the crash: that will tend to push the truck around. Actually the problem is much more fundamental. Even a magical device that measured the position of an electron without bouncing any stuff off of that electron would disturb the state of the electron in a detectable way. Are you familiar with polarizers? When light moves, it waves back and forth. That waving has a direction. It can wave up and down ( vertically ), left and right ( horizontally ), diagonally, whatever. A polarizer is a grating that blocks light waving against the grating from passing through. It only lets light that's waving along the grating pass through. But something interesting happens when light waving * diagonally * to the grating is passed through a polarizer. The light is partially let through, and * afterwards will be waving along the grating's direction *. You can use a polarizer to figure out how some unknown light is polarized. Pass the light through the polarizer and see how much light is let through as you turn the polarizer. Assuming the light doesn't contain a mix of polarizations, there will be a direction that lets all the light through. That's the polarization of the light. But suppose you don't have a beam of light. You have just a single photon. You want to figure out its polarization. Now the pass - it - through - polarizers - at - various - angles idea won't work so well. Even if the photon survives the first polarizer, its polarization is forced to wave along with the grating. The photon's polarization may have been diagonal to the grating beforehand, but not anymore. So a second polarizer can only tell us about the first polarizer's orientation, instead of about the photon's original polarization. In quantum mechanics, measurements behave like polarizers. You can use a measurement to split photons into a horizontally - polarized group and a vertically - polarized group, but doing so will force diagonally polarized photons to be horizontally or vertically polarized. Even worse, there's fundamentally no way to make the groupings finer: any process that splits photons into horizontal, vertical, and diagonal groups will be unreliable. All of this can be proven from the mathematical postulates of quantum mechanics. That's what physicists mean when they say that measurement changes a system in quantum mechanics: 1. The system can occupy a continuum of states, but measurement can only give discrete ( \" quantized \" ) results. 2. Further measurements only tell you about the previous measurement instead of about the system's original state. 3. Thus measurement forces systems \" diagonal \" to a measurement to be \" along - or - against \" that measurement, unavoidably affecting them."]}

What do you mean by \" sustainable \"? Antimatter annihilates when it comes into contact with normal matter. So, for instance, if a positron collides with an electron, they both disappear, and two gamma photons with the equivalent energy are released. Because of this, it's * very * hard to hold on to antimatter. You essentially need to use magnetic fields to hold tiny amounts of it in place without it touching anything else. It's also hard to make antimatter. It's produced in particle accelerators, which are massively expensive to run. To quote Wikipedia: > Scientists claim that antimatter is the costliest material to make. In 2006, Gerald Smith estimated $ 250 million could produce 10 milligrams of positrons ( equivalent to $ 25 billion per gram ); in 1999, NASA gave a figure of $ 62. 5 trillion per gram of antihydrogen. This is because production is difficult ( only very few antiprotons are produced in reactions in particle accelerators ), and because there is higher demand for other uses of particle accelerators. According to CERN, it has cost a few hundred million Swiss Francs to produce about 1 billionth of a gram ( the amount used so far for particle / antiparticle collisions ).", "It's certainly real. For example, if you 've ever heard of a PET scan, it stands for \" positron emission tomography ( topography? ). \" Positrons are antimatter, they 're \" anti - electrons. \" As for what it is... well, every particle has an antiparticle. An antiparticle is just the opposite of the \" regular \" particle that it corresponds to, for the most part. There are certain \" internal \" properties that any particle has, like its electric charge, and the corresponding antiparticle just has all the signs flipped on those properties ( they 're really numbers ). Some particles ( like photons ) are their own antiparticle, which is why I'm allowed to say every particle has an antiparticle. So, for example, the positron is the antiparticle of the electron, and it thus has positive charge. The \" external \" properties of the antiparticle are still the same as the internal ones. So, for example, the mass is the exact same. Other than the fact that it's weird to us, antimatter on its own doesn't really have any special properties that regular matter doesn't have. It's perfectly stable, all the forces and reactions are pretty much the same, yadda yadda. You can even make elements and compounds and stuff out of antimatter. For example, \" antihydrogen \" is just an antiproton and positron, and it behaves pretty much just like regular hydrogen. In fact, at least from a basic standpoint, the distinction between antimatter and regular matter is totally arbitrary. The universe could easily have consisted of antimatter, and we wouldn't notice any difference; we'd just think that electrons and protons are weird and positrons and antiprotons are normal. Now, for some reason, when you bring an antiparticle into contact with its corresponding particle, it \" annihilates, \" meaning that both particles completely disappear, and there's a big burst of radiation. That's why it's so hard to keep antimatter around: if it touches * anything *, it basically explodes. It's an extremely violent reaction, too. If we somehow could make an \" antipaperclip \" that consists entirely of antimatter, we'd have to be extremely careful with it, because if it touched a regular paperclip, it would release as much energy as a couple thousand nukes. It also turns out that when I said that antimatter is the exact same as regular matter, I was being a little misleading. The overwhelming majority of the time, the physical interactions in particle physics make no distinction between antimatter and regular matter. A photon, for example, doesn't care if it's interacting with a positron or an electron. There is, however, something called \" CP violation, \" which is an incredibly complex subject in and of itself. For our purposes, though, all you need to know is that the universe seems to make a totally arbitrary distinction between regular matter and antimatter. The classic example is the \" semileptonic decay of the long - lived neutral K meson. \" Without going into what the hell that means, there's basically a particle decay that can take two forms: one involving an electron, and one involving a positron. They should be equally likely if \" CP \" is a \" rule, \" but it turns out that the positron decay is a * tiny * bit more likely to happen, which is a CP violation. The way that physicists interpret this fact is that the universe does make some * tiny * sort of distinction between particles and antiparticles, though it's not totally clear why. It's thought that this tiny distinction is responsible for the fact that the universe consists of regular matter and not antimatter."]}

{"prompt": "The Baha'i Faith . Edit : Thanks everyone for the great answers ! Please explain like I'm five.", "human": ["Everyone has replied with a good general idea, so I thought I'd share from a talk ' Abdu'l - Baha made in Paris: \" Religion should unite all hearts and cause wars and disputes to vanish from the face of the earth; it should give birth to spirituality, and bring light and life to every soul. If religion becomes a cause of dislike, hatred and division it would be better to be without it, and to withdraw from such a religion would be a truly religious act. For it is clear that the purpose of a remedy is to cure, but if the remedy only aggravates the complaint, it had better be left alone. Any religion which is not a cause of love and unity is no religion. \"", "It's a monotheistic faith started by a Shi'a Muslim in 1844. It stresses that there is one God who is loving but doesn't interact with the world, that all known faiths are a manifestation of this God, and that all people are equal, whatever the faith, race, caste, sex, gender, whatever. Rather than Heaven and Hell, they believe that your spiritual development will correlate with how close you are to God after death, and one achieves this development by fostering world peace, creating harmony between science and religion, elimination of extreme wealth and poverty, and elimination of all kinds of prejudice.", "I grew up Baha'i, but I'm not religious now. I might not be 100 % on the details. Basically Baha'i believe that God reveals his message through different prophets or manifestations meant to reach different people in different times all to spread a very similar message of love and peace. Pretty much every major religious figure you 've heard of is considered a valid prophet: Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, Zoroaster etc. The most recent one that Baha'is stress is Bahaullah, who was a Persian man that preached that all religions worship the same god and are equally valid. Basically to a Baha'i it doesn't matter if you 're Baha'i, Muslim, Christian, Jewish or what not. You 're part of the one world religion. For example my brother got married to a Christian woman in a Christian church, that's perfectly acceptable as Christian churches are seen as part of the same single religion. Another major stress is that humanity and mankind are one race making a very strong theme of anti - racism and sexism ( although for some reason women still aren't allowed to serve at the highest levels of the Faith which is a major point of contention ). Also although the Faith places some strict rules, alcohol, drugs and homosexuality are considered sins and forbidden; it has a strong theme of accepting the sinner with their flaws. I remember as a kid going to tons Baha'i events, they 're very multicultural and accepting. It's really a religion of peace, love and accepting in my experience. Baha'is don't have many actual houses of worship. There's a major temple in Israel, but I don't know of any others. What they do is meet in local groups for prayer, usually at someone's house. There's also no clergy so you just meet at people's houses a few times a month in the evening. I'm running late for something so I got ta go, but I can answer more questions later if you have em!"]}

So your yield is lower which drives prices up. 3 ) You can make cheap processors out of expensive ones if they have a localized defect. Eg. if your 4 - core cpu has a defect in one core, you can just disable that and sell it as a three - core ( or two - core, or single - core ). 4 ) if the customer wants the most powerful CPU they are willing to pay for it ( because there are use cases where you can't scale over multiple machines or multiple processors because of latency and bandwidth constraints )."]}
{"prompt": "Can landlord/property change unit after approval and payment of fees?", "human": ["Without the specifics of the contract, as well as the specifics of the country/state/city you're moving to, it's hard to say what's legal. But this also isn't law. se, so I'll answer this from the point of view of personal finance, and what you can/should do as next steps. Whenever paying an application fee or a deposit, you need to ensure that you have in writing exactly what you're applying for or putting a deposit in for. Whether this is an apartment, a car, or a loan, before any money changes hands, you need to get in writing exactly what you're putting that money to. So for a car, you'd want to have the complete specifications - make, model, year, color, extra packages, and any relevant loan information if applicable. You wouldn't just hand a dealer $2000 for \"a Toyota Camry\", you'd make sure it was specified which one, in writing, as well as the total you're expecting to pay. Same for an apartment: you should have, in writing (email is fine) the specific unit you are putting a deposit for, and the specific rate you'll be paying, and the length of time the lease is for. This is to avoid a common tactic: bait and switch, which is what it looks like you've run into. A company puts forth a \"nice\" model, everything looks good, you get far enough in that it seems like you're locked in - and then it turns out you're really getting a less nice model that's not as ideal as whatever you signed up for. Now if you want to get what you originally signed up for you need to pay extra - presumably \"something was wrong in the original ad\", or something like that. And all you can hear in the background is Darth Vader... \"I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further. \" So; what do you do when you've been bait-and-switched? The best thing to do is typically to walk away. Try to get your application fee back; you may or may not be able to, but it's worth a shot, and even if you cannot, walk away anyway. Someone who is going to bait-and-switch on you is probably not going to be a good landlord; my guess is that rent is going to keep going up beyond the level of the market, and you probably can kiss your security deposit goodbye. Second, if walking away isn't practical for whatever reason, you can find out what the local laws are. Some locations (though very few, sadly) require advertised prices to be accurate; particularly the fact that they re-advertised the unit again for the same rate suggests they are falling afoul of that. You can ask around, search the internet, or best yet talk to a lawyer who specializes in this sort of thing; some of them will be willing to at least answer a few questions for free (hoping to score your business for an easy, profitable lawsuit). Be aware that it's not exactly a good situation to be in, to be suing your landlord; second only to suing your employer, in my opinion, in terms of bad things to do while hoping to continue the relationship. Find an alternative as soon as you can if you go this route. In the future, pay a lot of attention to detail when making application fees. Often the application fee is needed before you get into too much detail - but pick a location that has reasonable application fees, and no extras. For example, in my area, it's typical to pay a $25 application fee, nonrefundable, to do the credit check and background check, and a refundable $100-$200 deposit to hold the unit while doing that; a place that asks for a non-refundable deposit is somewhere I'd simply not apply at all."]}

The North continued to use the American flag, though of course it had less stars than it does now ( less states ). Since slavery was one of the main causes of the civil war ( despite revisionist claims ), it is associated with white supremacy movements and ideas since that time. The South's long legacy in making non - whites second - class citizens during the Jim Crow era ( basically post - Reconstruction until the 1960s ) also increased the association between those with a fondness for the rebel flag and racism. In addition, it was and is used by many racist organizations and individuals as a symbol of their beliefs. To be fair, however, for some it is a symbol of Southern cultural identity without overt racist elements, but I generally feel that this argument is too ontological and ignores the strong associations the flag has and the effect embracing it has on people who think about those associations.

My friends say he uses a lot of jinnis but not all jinni are bad, some follow Islam or Christianity or other religions, they are simply a race we can not see. It is said 1/3 of angels followed Iblis but angels can not disobey god's will so some refute this. Lucifer & Iblis are his personal names, Satan / Devil are his given names after he was banished.", "As these terms usually relate to the Biblical ' being ', I will base my answers on evidence in the bible: - * * devil * *, usually translated from the Hebrew * ' diabolos ' *. Which means * ' slanderer ' * or * ' false accuser ' *. Nothing to do with a super - natural being. If interested see I Timothy 3: 11, 2 Timothy 3: 1 - 3, Titus 2: 3 for uses of that word, not translated to devil. Also, Jesus calls Judas as devil in John 6: 70.

This is the fallen King of Babylon mentioned only once in Isaiah 14 and only in the King James translation of the bible. Again human, no relation to devil. - * * satan * *, the root Hebrew word is * ' satanas ' *, its not written with a capital S, so the writers are were not inferring a name. This word means * ' opponent ' * or * ' adversary ' *. In Matt 16: 23 Peter was called a ' satan ', again not indication of a super - natural being, no relation to the other 2. - * * Damian * * - no idea! I know * demons * in the Bible usually refer to a mental illness which could not be explained at the time, like in Mark 9: 18.

{"prompt": "Can a stock exchange company actually go bust?", "human": ["Technically, of course. Almost any company can go bankrupt. One small note: a company goes bankrupt, not its stock. Its stock may become worthless in bankruptcy, but a stock disappearing or being delisted doesn't necessarily mean the company went bankrupt. Bankruptcy has implications for a company's debt as well, so it applies to more than just its stock. I don't know of any historical instances where this has happened, but presumably, the warning signs of bankruptcy would be evident enough that a few things could happen. Another company, e. g. another exchange, holding firm, etc. could buy out the exchange that's facing financial difficulty, and the companies traded on it would transfer to the new company that's formed. If another exchange bought out the struggling exchange, the shares of the latter could transfer to the former. This is an attractive option because exchanges possess a great deal of infrastructure already in place. Depending on the country, this could face regulatory scrutiny however. Other firms or governments could bail out the exchange if no one presented a buyout offer. The likelihood of this occurring depends on several factors, e. g. political will, the government(s) in question, etc. For a smaller exchange, the exchange could close all open positions at a set price. This is exactly what happened with the Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange (HKMex) that MSalters mentioned. When the exchange collapsed in May 2013, it closed all open positions for their price on the Thursday before the shutdown date. I don't know if a stock exchange would simply close all open positions at a set price, since equity technically exists in perpetuity regardless of the shutdown of an exchange, while many derivatives have an expiration date. Furthermore, this might not be a feasible option for a large exchange. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange lists thousands of products and manages hundreds of millions of transactions, so closing all open positions could be a significant undertaking. If none of the above options were available, I presume companies listed on the exchange would actively move to other, more financially stable exchanges. These companies wouldn't simply go bankrupt. Contracts can always be listed on other exchanges as well. Considering the high level of mergers and acquisitions, both unsuccessful and successful, in the market for exchanges in recent years, I would assume that option 1 would be the most likely (see the NYSE Euronext/Deutsche Börse merger talks and the NYSE Euronext/ICE merger that's currently in progress), but for smaller exchanges, there is the recent historical precedent of the HKMex that speaks to #3. Also, the above answer really only applies to publicly traded stock exchanges, and not all stock exchanges are publicly-held entities. For example, the Shanghai Stock Exchange is a quasi-governmental organization, so I presume option 2 would apply because it already receives government backing. Its bankruptcy would mean something occurred for the government to withdraw its backing or that it became public, and a discussion of those events occurring in the future is pure speculation."]}

A skilled cracker can find that code and use it to make his own key. That's not possible if the key is checked online, but then the software needs to contain a statement like this: if ( keyisValid ) continue ( ); else showError ( ); And a cracker could simply change this to: if ( keyisValid ) continue ( ); else continue ( ); The software could also contain a self - check to see if it's been modified, but that too is something that can be diabled in a similar fashion. Finding and disabling all these various checks can take a tremendous amount of time and skill, because the cracker doesn't have the original human - readable source code and is just looking at machine code intended to be read by CPU, which is much harder to make sense of, but ultimately there's always a way to keep the parts of the software you want ( the ones that make up the actual program ) and get rid of the parts you don't want ( the anti - piracy stuff ), if you can identify what's what. The original programmer can try to hide, scatter or obfuscate the anti - cracking stuff to make it harder to find, use something that apparently looks like anti - cracking code to mislead the crackers or hide it inside parts of a game that take hours of play to get to to make the cracker waste time, but ultimately, it's gon na be there somewhere and can be modified.

If vital parts of the game ( like parts of the game logic itself ) run on a server and the copy shipped to users is not a complete application, then crackers will not be able to see the code itself ( only its output ) and won't be able to modify it.

I suppose the rationale for loaning 80% is so that you will fork our 20% first, and so your property is protected from fluctuations in the market, that they do not need to collect additional money from you as your housing valuation rarely drops below 80% of the original price. Banks do need to make money too, as they run as a business."]}

{"prompt": "Looking for advice on rental property", "human": ["You say that one property is 65% of the value of the two properties and the other is 35%. But how much of that do the two of you actually own? If you have co-signed mortgages on both properties, then your equity is going to be lower. If you sold both properties, then your take away would be just half of that equity. And while the 35% property may be less valuable, if you bought it first, it may actually have more equity. It's the equity that matters here, not the value of the property. With a mortgage, the bank is more of an owner than you are until you've paid down most of the loan. You may find that the bank won't agree to a single-owner refinance. A co-signed mortgage is a lot easier for them to collect, as they can hold either of you responsible for the entire loan. If you sell the 65% property, then you can pay off any mortgage on that property and use the equity payout from that to buy out your relative on the 35% property. If you currently have no mortgage, you'd even have cash back. This is your fewest strings option. Let's say that you have no mortgage now. So this mortgage would be the only mortgage on the property. It's not so much, as 15: 65 is 3: 13 or 18. 75% of the value of the property. That's more of a home equity loan than a mortgage. You should be able to get a good rate. It might reduce your short term profit, but it should be survivable if you have other income. If you don't have other income, then seriously consider selling the 65% property and diversifying the payout into something else. E. g. stocks and bonds. Perhaps your relative would be willing to float you the loan. That would save you bank fees and closing costs. Write up a contract and agree to take assignment of the title at payoff. You'll need to pay a lawyer to write up the contract (paying a modest amount now to cover the various future possibilities), but that should still be cheaper. There's a certain amount of trust required on both sides, but this gives you some separation. And of course it takes your relative out of the day-to-day management entirely. Perhaps the steady flow of cash would provide what they need. If your relative is willing to remain that involved, that can work. Note that they may not want to do this, so don't get too attached to the idea. Be prepared for a no. This would be a great option for you, as you pretty much get everything you have now. They get back the time meeting with you to make decisions, but they also give up control over those decisions. Some people would not like that tradeoff. The one time I was involved with a professional managing a property for me, the fee was around 7% of the rent. If that fits your area, you might reasonably charge 5%. That gives a discount for family and not being a professional. There's a relatively easy way to find out what fits your area. Look around and see what companies offer multiple listings. Call until you find a couple that will do management for you. Get quotes for managing your properties. Now you'll know the amounts. The big failing though is that this may not describe the issue that your relative has. If the real problem is that the two of you have different approaches to property management, then making you the only decision maker may be the wrong direction. This is certainly financially feasible, but it still may not be the right solution for your relationship. If you get a no on this, I'd recommend moving on to other solutions immediately. This may simply be too favorable to you."]}

Even if wrongfully accused, an innocent person will sit in jail for months or years waiting for the appeal. Note that this step only occurs for someone tried in a state court. Those tried at the federal level skip this step and go directly to federal habeus corpus. * Federal habeus corpus - This is essentially a lawsuit filed by the accused to be reviewed in a federal court, which supercedes the states ' justice system. In this stage of appeal, they review whether or not the accused's constitutional rights were upheld, and this is also the place where new evidence can be introduced. Roughly 21 % of death penalty cases have been reversed at the federal level, due largely in part to the introduction of DNA evidence acquitting people accused of murder before DNA evidence was readily available and trusted.

{"prompt": "How to diversify IRA portfolio given fund minimum investments and IRA contribution limits?", "human": ["Many mutual fund companies (including Vanguard when I checked many years ago) require smaller minimum investments (often $1000) for IRA and 401k accounts. Some also allow for smaller investments into their funds for IRA accounts if you set up an automatic investment plan that contributes a fixed amount of money each month or each quarter. On the other hand, many mutual fund companies charge an annual account maintenance fee ($10? $20? $25? more? ) per fund for IRA investments unless the balance in the fund is above a certain amount (often $5K or $10K$). This fee can be paid in cash or deducted from the IRA investment, and the former option is vastly better. So, diversification into multiple funds while starting out with an IRA is not that great an idea. It is far better to get diversification through investment in an S&P 500 Index fund (VFINX since you won't have access to @JoeTaxpayer's VIIIX) or a Total Market Index fund or, if you prefer, a Target Retirement Fund, and then branch out into other types of mutual funds as your investment grows through future contributions and dividends etc. To answer your question about fund minimums, the IRA account is separate from a taxable investment account, and the minimum rule applies to each separately.

The idea is that we are all traveling through spacetime with a constant speed. We see ourselves as traveling through only time ( forward ). Others can seem to be traveling only through time ( forward ) if they are moving with us. In other words, they don't seem to be moving relative to us. However, if another object is traveling with some speed relative to us, we will see them as traveling slower in time ( forwards relative to us ). Since not every objects is traveling in the same direction as us, other objects appear to be traveling through space at different speeds.

Time is relative in the same way that forward is relative.", "It's called \" spacetime, \" and calling it a \" continuum \" doesn't really mean anything. It's just a word non - scientists sometimes use because … I don't know why, to be honest. The long and short of it, though, is that measurements of things like distances and durations are dependent on where you stand when you make the measurement. In some ways, this is obvious: If I'm * here * and I'm measuring the distance from * here * to * there *, I'm going to get one number. If you 're standing * elsewhere * and measuring the distance from where you are to the same point, you 're going to get a different number. That's obvious. But other consequences of this fact turn out to be surprising. For instance, say I'm standing * here * and measuring the distance between two other points, call them A and B. One might think that if you 're standing * there * and you measure the distance between the same points, you 'll get the same answer I did. I mean, they 're the same points, right? Well, it turns out to be more complicated than that. You and I are * not * guaranteed to get the same answer when we measure the distance between two points. How far apart two points are depends on where we are and how we 're moving when we make the measurement. This fact also applies to * distances in time, * which is just another way of saying durations. One might think, based on our intuition, that everybody will agree on how much time elapses between two events that happen at the same place — say, two blinks of a light. But in fact, this is not the case. Different observers do not necessarily agree on the * distance in time * between two events. How * far apart in time * two events are depends on where we are and how we 're moving when we make the measurement. That's why the idea of spacetime exists. It turns out that distance - in - space and distance - in - time ( or duration, in other words ) are actually closely related concepts, and when you get into the details of how my measurements relate to your measurements you find that space and time distances get mixed up into each other. Distance in space and distance in time are just * components * of distance in spacetime. Nobody noticed any of these facts for about ten thousand years of recorded history because the difference between my measurements and your measurements is very, very tiny unless we 're moving * incredibly fast * relative to each other. That's why you can go through life not worrying about converting from your measurements to mine or vice versa; at the kinds of speeds human beings experience directly, your measurements and mine are so close together as to make no difference at the scales we care about. But if we cared about a far finer scale — for example, if we all had super - precise clocks and super - precise rulers and we cared about differences of trillionths of a second and trillionths of an inch — we would understand these things intuitively, because we'd have been dealing with them every day all along.", "Let me try for a EL10 perspective, at least. It's because light behaves differently than what we are used to, and some very smart people deduced incredible things from that observation. So, imagine you 're watching a car drive by you. And you have a radar gun, and you can see it's going at 45 mph. then the person in the car throws a ball forward at 15 mph. Because the car was already going at 45 mph, the ball, from your perspective, goes 60 mph. If he throws another ball behind him at 15 mph, the ball, from your perspective, will get the added boost from the car, minus the 15 mph from the throw, and will be going 30 mph. The problem is, light is different. Light doesn't behave that way. Light doesn't get the boost or subtraction that the ball gets. Light always travels at the same speed. So, shining the light out of the car at 45 mph, forward? The light goes at the speed of light, or the constant we call * c *, not * c*+45 mph. Similarly, light shining backwards doesn't go * c*-45 mph, it always goes at * c *. * Always. * So this doesn't really mean much until you start thinking about large distances or going very, very fast. Let me give you an example that may help you understand. Instead of a car, I'm in a space ship that can go * just barely * under the speed of light. Let's say it can go something crazy, like 99. 999999999999999999 % * c *. And somehow, you 're on Earth, able to see in the spaceship the entire time. And now I shine a light at a wall a few feet in front of me. Now, I'm in the spaceship. To my eyes, the light goes from my flashlight at * c * to the wall. It seems instantaneous to me. You, however, are watching on Earth. You also see the light going at * c * out of my flashlight. But the spaceship is almost catching up to it. The light is crawling out of the flashlight and seems to take forever to get to the wall. So because we are in different places at different speeds, called * reference frames *, we both experience something completely different. All because light always, * always * travels at the same speed, no matter what. So something else must change. As we see, time is what changes. To me, on the ship, the light behaves like it always does. To you, on earth, it seems as if time itself on the spaceship has slowed to a crawl. So that's why time is relative. It's because light is not relative. Light is invariant ( does not change. ) I hope that helps. ( On a side note, yes, light can be * slowed * by moving through a material other than a vaccum, but from a technical standpoint, the light doesn't actually slow down, it just bounces around a lot. )"]}

{"prompt": "Video Game Programming I do n't understand the basic concept of how the programming is done , also I do n't understand how graphics are produced . I know a tiny bit of tech lingo , so be gentle . Explain like I'm five.", "human": ["Ok, this is two questions in one really. A game is quite simple: start two complementary processes: the first one is monitoring the user input, and applying changes to the game data ( stored in the computer memory ) as it sees fits. Once the input has been applied, it also applies a set of rules to change everything not in direct control of the player: the monsters, the physics, etc. the second one read aforementioned data and show pretty pictures on the screen based on said data. That's all, nothing more, nothing less. Obviously, said processes has evolved over time. In the DOS days, it was a story of interruptions and stuff - just imagine two hungered kids taking turns from a bucket of Doritos: working pretty good, but a bit messy. Now it's really concurrent threads, working independently and taking advantage of our computer's CPU having really two or more \" core \": then the different processes really run independently. As for the graphics, in a \" triple A \" game, it's usually the work of an army of 3d modelers, animators and such, all working to create something the game 3D engine can use. The work is really comparable to creating a 3D movie, it's just that the picture won't get out of a rendering cloud, but instead out of the game engine. If no 3D is used, then it's only a matter of being really good at drawing a lot of pictures which are all really close to one another, as the movements in the game need to be decomposed in a series of pictures, just like a movie. Except that any possible movement of the character, monster or whatnot have to be created. A bit tedious, isn't it?", "When you write a piece of software, you basically are making a list of instructions for a calculator to perform. You have your operations: You can Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, or MOD ( Obtain the remainder of a division ), two numbers. ( There are also lots of operations that modify the bits inside of these numbers, that are useful for talking to hardware, or optimizing certain operations ) You then have control pieces: A mechanism to LOAD, STORE, GOTO, IF, BRANCH IF 0, and you can do a lot of complicated things. A machine that can do this basic set of things is known as being Turing Complete. Pretty much anything that can be algorithmically represented or modeled, can be modeled with a Turing Complete machine-- this includes video games. Doing so at a low level is really difficult though- so people made programming languages, which can use simpler terms, and then generate a bunch of the above listed instructions which accomplish the same thing. Computers then need to talk to hardware. In the early days it was just TTYs, basically terminals that you could communicate with via serial. The CPU would have hardware on it that could turn a pin on and off when you LOAD or STORE to a specific address ( Addresses normally will store into memory, but these magical addresses would instead communicate with hardware ). For instance, your parallel port is located at 0x0378. Writing a number to this address sets the pins on your parallel port to 0V for a 0 bit, or 12V for a 1 bit in the corresponding number written to that address. Write to another address, and you 're writing to memory, and you can basically just save that data there, and retrieve it later. By interfacing with this graphical hardware, you could make english characters, but there was also a predefined set of all sorts of other characters- ASCII. URL_0 Need a brick wall? ASCII character 178 would do, need a Lion, 234 looks good enough to me! Basically though, after a short period of time, people realize that these characters looked nothing like lions, or brick walls-- and decided to start making hardware specifically for doing graphics. The same process underneath applies, the hardware exposes some set of registers for configuring it, and you can then do fancy things using those same LOAD and STORE operations to drop data into video memory. This video memory on modern graphics cards basically is a big blob of pixels that represent all of the pixels on your monitor ranging from left to right. The data you put into this memory controls what color pixel shows on your monitor. People could then make software to draw images into these pixels. Computers still are massively slow, and imagine having to recalculate the value of every one of those pixels 60 times a second? It's extremely taxing on the processor. In order to accomplish this, hardware has been created that can abstract the way in which these pixels are produced into a higher level of concepts. This is where 3d graphics processing comes from. Basically now you can talk to the hardware and say, \" Draw me a polygon, rotate it 30 degrees, and apply this 3D transform to it, then dump it into video memory at this location. \" The model behind the scenes storing where the items are located, how much health a character has, the script for the story etc, are really no more sophisticated now than they were when people were using the ASCII lions and brick walls. All that has changed is the ability to render the story using this specific 3D hardware that gives programmers a great deal of control for how to display these things.", "In concept it's not really any different than programming a calculator or other interactive program. You have a data structure, a view of that data structure that you present to the user and then that data structure evolves according to rules the programmer makes which may or may not take input from the user. In games the data structure could represent a big evolving world in which the player controls one character, or it could be a bunch of blocks in a grid... essentially anything you think can be engaging for the player to interact with. Graphics production is usually built on top of [ OpenGL ] ( URL_1 ) or [ DirectX ] ( URL_0 ), the major graphics APIs in the market. These are standardised ways to specify things to draw ( supported by graphics hardware manufacturers ) that allow you to use the graphics card's dedicated circuits to do the math of drawing a 3D scene, calculating how light spreads through it and similar problems. There's a lot of complexity to dive into here and I 've only surface knowledge of it myself, so I 'll stop here."]}

Any laws that follow it have can't contradict something within the Constitution. Laws passed in the USA are known as the \" US Code \". The Constitution can be changed. When that happens it's done via an amendment. There are 27 Constitutional Amendments. One example is the 17th amendment. It used to be that Senators were picked by state legislatures but the 17th amendment changed that to direct election by the populace. Laws themselves can be amended though. If you and I are in congress and I propose a law that says dogs and votes you can try to amend that to allow cats to vote as well.", "Amendments are much more difficult to pass -- or overturn. At the federal level an amendment can be brought forth by a 2/3 majority in both houses of congress or by a constitutional convention called by 2/3 of the states. Once it passes that level it must be ratified by 3/4 of the states. By comparison, a law can be passed with a simple majority in both houses of congress plus the signature of the president ( although in practice House and Senate rules are structured such that a bill needs a 3/5 majority in the Senate and a majority of the majority party in the House ). Laws are intended for the day - to - day governing of the nation. Amendments are meant for either things that are so fundamental that they must be protected from the occasional swings of political whim or for things that are related to how the government itself is structured. Amendments have superiority to laws, so a law is insufficient to change something that is specified by the Constitution. Note that at the state level this model is usually followed, but is sometimes corrupted. For example, Texas has been through a few constitutions. With the previous one the state government was felt to have too much power, so the current Texas constitution makes it difficult for the state government to get much done by simply passing state laws. As a result, the current Texas constitution has 673 attempted amendments of which 491 passed. Alabama, similarly, has passed 926 amendments over such minor things as [ establishing that the Judge in one county shall be paid a salary ] ( URL_0 ).", "One important difference that I haven't yet seen mentioned is the role of the Supreme Court. A law passed by the normal procedures of the legislature can be challenged in court, and evaluated against what the Constitution mandates or allows. An amendment, on the other hand, * changes the standard by which laws are evaluated. * As a result, there is no mechanism for challenging the legitimacy of an amendment; there's no higher standard by which to judge it. It is definitionally correct in the context of US jurisprudence. So it's possible for the Supreme Court to \" strike down\"^ * a law by saying \" this is inconsistent with the powers granted to the federal government by the Constitution. \" An amendment can not be struck down by the court. For example, you could reasonably bring a case to the Supreme Court appealing federal law which governs marijuana. You could argue that banning the sale, trade, or use of marijuana is not a power the government is granted; that the effect of the marijuana trade does not rise to the level of altering interstate commerce, and the the laws should not be enforced. This is a case that it would be legally possible for you to win. By contrast, between 1919 and 1932 ( that is, after the 18th amendment - prohibition - was ratified, but before the 21st - repealing prohibition - was ratified ), the commercial manufacture of alcoholic beverages for routine consumption was Constitutionally banned. You would have had no legal grounds on which to bring a case arguing that alcohol should be legal, because the very standard by which \" should \" was evaluated had been changed. This is, IMO, the most important reason the bar for passing an amendment is so high - there is no mechanism for appeal or change beyond electing new representatives who will do so. ^ * Notably, they don't actually strike it down; they don't have the power to change or eliminate laws. But as the highest court in a system which is governed by precedent, if the Supreme Court rules that they will not enforce a given law based on it conflicting with the standards set by the Constitution, then all other lower courts are legally bound to also not enforce that law."]}

But when you look at the moon, you are not looking at the moon as it is right now but as it was 1, 3 seconds ago. And if you feel the warmth of the sun on your body, that energy has been travelling through space from the sun to you for about 8 minutes! That also means that if you look at the sun, you are watching what happened 8 minutes ago. No matter what you do, you can't change what happens on the sun in 4 minutes if you start now to plan something. Because you can't travel faster than this speed of light. Now think about the universe that is infinite. Do you think you can see the whole universe? No you can't, because it takes time for light to reach you. If something is billion billion billion billion billion billion billion light years away then it will take billion billion billion billion billion billion light years to get here, and the universe just isn't old enough for light to have reached all that way. So if you look around you into space, there is a limit to how far you can see, until you can't see further. We call this the \" observable universe \", which is simply how far we can yet see. Our observable universe is like a * * huge * * bubble around us, and it contains everything that we can see. But all that was once closer together, at the big bang. It was so close together that it was just condensed in a tiny little dot. Our whole observable universe was once just a dot. And around that dot there was even more stuff. We don't know what it was, but we assume that it was just like the stuff that our ' dot ' has. So there you have it. An infinite universe that was infinitely dense and time was stopped. Then for some reason expansion started, it happened incredibly fast, so fast that space expanded faster than the speed of light and now there are parts of the universe we actually just can't see. Then the expansion slowed down, but later it picked up speed and is now going faster and faster. Eventually, physicists think, other galaxies will be moving away from us faster than the speed of light - which means we won't be able to see them any more. That also means that any future alien civilizations will not be able to see other galaxies move away from each other, and they are just going to have a completely wrong picture of the universe because they don't know how it all started. The only reason * we * do is because we can observe galaxies moving away from us faster and faster. And this is the only time in the history of the universe that we are able to do that. So we are pretty lucky to be living in the time where we can know this for sure, because this information will be lost forever to everyone else who will be isolated in their galaxy in billions of years."]}

In a video game, you are looking around, running, and jumping ( and sometimes flying! ) dynamically as the environment changes. You need those 60 frames per second to give you the maximum amount of information and fluidity to the image. In TV and movies, 24fps is acceptable because it adds a somewhat cinematic ( though that is self - completing ) and dramatic appearance to motion. The problem with 24p is that any fast pans or quick motions become choppy and often blurry. In the business of cinematography ( recording those images, and also what I do as a job! ), we compensate for this problem using certain tricks of human cognition and optical perspective. That was a bit wordy. What I mean is, if we need to pan quickly around a room, we keep you from being disoriented by having the camera follow an actor or an object which is moving around the room. The actor / object stays in the same place on the screen ( more or less ), so the viewer locks onto it and doesn't notice the stuttering and choppy pan in the background. If we don't have someone to watch move around, we can ' whip pan ', which is panning so fast that everything blurs together and it is over before you know it. In some cases, we want to utilize the stuttery motion of 24p to our own advantage. Think saving private ryan.

{"prompt": "Please explain what is \"Computer vision\"", "human": ["Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e. g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory. The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multi-dimensional data from a 3D scanner, or medical scanning devices. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems. Sub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, 3D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, 3D scene modeling, and image restoration."]}

Let's say we stretch that milk carton to a height of 10 meters ( about the size of a three - story house ) and fill it up with water.

Every ten meters, you add another atmosphere. So at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, which is over 10, 000 meters deep, the pressure is over 1000 atmospheres. To put that back in terms of the carton, it would be about the weight of one and a half space shuttles on your head! So that's what atmospheric pressure is, a measurement of the weight of the column of stuff stacked up on top of a given surface area."]}

{"prompt": "How are GMO 's created and why do they threaten the environment ? Have an assignment on this and I 'm completely lost in the jargon Explain like I'm five.", "human": ["Without mentioning biodiversity or ecology, GMOs will not harm us, the consumers from a dietary point of view. Every time we eat food, we are consuming the organism's DNA. The DNA and RNA is broken down into nucleotides and absorbed as such. So why in the world would the sequence of the DNA matter if it is being broken down anyway? GMO's have a different sequence of DNA than the wild type organisms, and it will not hurt us. Notice, this is different than adding hormones or pesticides to foods.", "I will try to answer a bit about how GMO's are created while avoiding jargon. So GMO stands for genetically modified organism. At the basics organisms have a code inside them with the instructions how to build that organism. Parts of these instructions is what we call genes. Now scientist have developed ways to take parts of these instructions from one organism and place them in another organism. Effectively modifying that organism. A famous example is the insulin producing bacteria. What they did was they took the human instructions on how to build the molecule insulin and placed it inside a bacteria. This bacteria when grown started producing insulin that we could use for treatment for diabetes. Another thing you can do is putting instructions on how to beat certain bacteria, viruses or fungi inside your crop so that they don't die because of disease. The possibilities are endless.", "Everyone here is describing why they are safe for human consumption, and how the hippies are wrong and blah, blah, blah. But OP asked why they threaten the environment. I will make this concise as I am on my phone, but GMOs are thought to be harmful to the environment because they affect the biodiversity of an area. Peru, which is known for it's very diverse potato crops, have instituted a ban on GMOs to protect that diversity. It is also thought that crops such as Bt - corn can have unintended interactions with indigenous, non - pest, insects, by means of its pollen. Some also argue that pesticide and herbicide resistant crops are creating \" super \" pests and weeds; that over time the pests and weeds are building up an immunity. This is not to say that GMOs are bad. They have many positive applications, but they can have negative effects on the surrounding environment. If you are required to write a paper on the environmental threats GMO poses, I would also take a look at the beneficial aspects. I believe it's important to have a well rounded opinion on the matter.

If you have ever been to court for a traffic ticket, the cop usually has a fair amount of information. They also typically run your information through data bases -- The relevant motor bureau to check up on your driving record / make sure you are licensed and to check registration / insurance and they also may use a system such as NCIC to check your criminal record / make sure you don't have any outstanding warrants. If they don't have computers in their car, this can take even longer since they have to get all their information through the dispatcher on the radio."]}
